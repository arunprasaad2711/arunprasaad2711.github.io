<div class="line-block">Turning another leaf, as you go around the sun,<br />
You might wonder and ponder, what’s going on?<br />
Your purpose in life, and what you’re doing with it,<br />
The days that pass by and the days yet to come.<br />
<br />
A new leaf at this age can be quite taxing,<br />
With the world in a pandemic, it is harder than usual.<br />
While you work hard, to reach your dreams and goals,<br />
What can I say to you, my friendly caregiver?<br />
<br />
This is no advice, as the world has it in suffice,<br />
Just thoughts and words, that could be soothing.<br />
Do reach out to them, when you’re in need,<br />
I’ll be delighted to know if this helped you in some way.<br />
<br />
You are a dreamer, in this practical world,<br />
And you might seem misplaced, and rightly so.<br />
But the practical world, can’t exist at all,<br />
If your kind was not born at all!<br />
<br />
That is the power, of dreams and visions,<br />
It is the one, that can contort reality,<br />
Into ways and means, the non-dreamers can’t see,<br />
And makes the impossible, possible by good means.<br />
<br />
Dare to dream big, and dare to push your limits,<br />
You don’t have to be, the dutiful adult you are,<br />
Once in a while, listen to your inner child,<br />
No one can be as selfless as an innocent child.<br />
<br />
An empath at heart, you care for animals more,<br />
For you say, that they behave better than people.<br />
While it is true, in many many accounts,<br />
I request you to not, shut your door on people.<br />
<br />
Like the clouds that can hide the sun,<br />
Many vices from humans, can hide humanity,<br />
But do be strong, and notice humans more,<br />
For there is still hope, and hope is not lost.<br />
<br />
While you are special, special in many ways,<br />
Do keep in mind, that you are a human too,<br />
You have your own many quirks and flaws,<br />
That makes you unique, and one of a kind.<br />
<br />
Do show yourself a lot of kindness,<br />
The same kindness you show to others.<br />
Especially when you’re hurt and sad,<br />
Especially when you feel inadequate.<br />
<br />
There is an abundance of goodness around us,<br />
And there is an abundance of evil too!<br />
It is a daily fight, to preserve the goodness in us,<br />
And it is tough, to fight darkness every day.<br />
<br />
This fight is hard when your goals are different,<br />
And even harder to convince, the unwilling hearts,<br />
It is quite alright, to feel lost at these times,<br />
With time and planning, you will surely win.<br />
<br />
It is quite painful when hurt by the ones you love,<br />
It can be scary, to trust people back again,<br />
Do take your time, to heal from the pain,<br />
And ask help when needed, we can sort it out.<br />
<br />
When you feel down, sad, or lost,<br />
Do take some time, and take it slow,<br />
Give yourself time, to heal and recover,<br />
Show yourself patience, to bounce back better.<br />
<br />
Ash turns to Diamond, amidst all the pressure,<br />
With support, you will become a diamond too!<br />
So aim high, and take the chances and risks,<br />
We’re here to support you, you’ll be fine!<br />
<br />
Whenever you feel sad, and feel hopeless,<br />
Do keep in mind, a simple metaphor in life,<br />
Happiness and sadness comes in waves,<br />
And as they say, waves don’t stay for long.<br />
<br />
You have the strength, and power within you,<br />
Take your time, and harness it with conviction,<br />
A person of substance, you’re one of a kind,<br />
An infinite universe, in a finite human being.<br />
<br />
This is your life, my dear caregiver!<br />
You have the right, to make it as you please!<br />
Listen to your heart, for what is right and wrong,<br />
And build the courage to follow it through.<br />
<br />
Do surround yourself, with people who love you,<br />
For they can either, make you or break you,<br />
You care for others a lot, despite your troubles,<br />
Do let the ones you love, take care of you too?<br />
<br />
Don’t hesitate to shine, as radiant as the sun,<br />
And dare to fill, the dark cosmos with light.<br />
In your own pace, and in your own time,<br />
For you are special, the child of the sun!</div>
