                <h1 id="star-child">Star Child</h1>
<div class="line-block">Days will come and days will go,<br />
The trifles of life can weigh you down.<br />
Hope may seem bleak and future uncertain, - yet,<br />
Don't settle for the dust, my star child.<br />
<br />
Your blissful solitude may turn to silence,<br />
Your heart might prefer violence,<br />
Amidst hardship, defeat and despair,<br />
Don't settle for the dust, my star child.<br />
<br />
When the myriad walls that keep you safe break,<br />
Making you question your faith,<br />
Keeping you pondering with sleepless nights,<br />
Don't settle for the dust, my star child.<br />
<br />
At these times, hope may seem faint,<br />
You might feel well-off being a saint,<br />
With trials and tribulations seemingly vain,<br />
Don't settle for the dust, my star child.<br />
<br />
When your lookout for love goes barren,<br />
When drifting friendships make you sad,<br />
When the gravity of reality weighs on you,<br />
Don't settle for the dust, my star child.<br />
<br />
Days will go, but keep fighting,<br />
The war will be won, despite a few battles,<br />
Where is the chase when things go smooth?<br />
Be strong and move on, my star child.<br />
<br />
Search your feelings in the cold silence,<br />
You will know that there is no end to violence,<br />
The harder you burn on the inside,<br />
The brighter you shine to all my star child.<br />
<br />
Walls can crumble, but ideas cannot,<br />
Test your faith; it strengthens your resolve,<br />
Confront the storm with might, my dear,<br />
You will emerge stronger, my star child.<br />
<br />
Flow like a stream my star child,<br />
Forge your way, noble and brave.<br />
All your efforts will come around,<br />
You'll reap bounties far and wide.<br />
<br />
Pursue your passion my star child,<br />
Lose your self and bask in its glory.<br />
Your passion will find your lost self back,<br />
Infinitely strong and wise you'll become,<br />
<br />
You are not alone, my star child,<br />
There are many like you burning inside,<br />
Amidst pain and suffering, they are bright,<br />
A symbol they are, that all things not lost.<br />
<br />
Why do we fall? Tell me my star child,<br />
To master the art of picking ourselves up.<br />
The bigger you fall, the higher you rise,<br />
Keep moving; you are in for a surprise.<br />
<br />
You might seem odd, unflagging all alone,<br />
But your light guides the mortals in their nights.<br />
Lost in the sea navigating on chunks of dust,<br />
Finding their way home, in vast never-ending seas.<br />
<br />
Real friends are like stars, my star child,<br />
Sometimes, they are far far away.<br />
But they are always around you,<br />
Even in your darkest night my dear.<br />
<br />
You are the child of sun my dear one,<br />
Born to accomplish a higher purpose.<br />
The gravity of it is unfathomable,<br />
To other mortals who try to eclipse you.<br />
<br />
Your grandparents the cosmos, are there for you,<br />
Looking after you, through thick and thin.<br />
As we speak, they listen to your prayers,<br />
And conspiring an angel for you.<br />
<br />
You will meet the angel from heaven,<br />
Forged in hellfire, nourished by the elixir.<br />
You will find love and the whole nine yards,<br />
So do not be sad, soon, you'll be glad.<br />
<br />
You are the child of sun my dear one,<br />
After every winter, you'll face a summer,<br />
So don't settle for the dust, my star child,<br />
For you are the substance that makes suns!</div>
