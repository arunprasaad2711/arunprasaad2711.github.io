                <h1 id="unopened-doors">Unopened Doors</h1>
<div class="line-block">There was a breeze,<br />
It blew between trees,<br />
Thawed my heart old,<br />
Rusty and cold.<br />
<br />
Finding trust is very rare,<br />
Earlier I didn't care,<br />
I wandered here and there,<br />
I couldn't find it anywhere.<br />
<br />
This breeze I saw,<br />
Made my heart thaw,<br />
I then had a light,<br />
My future was bright.<br />
<br />
I was kind and warm,<br />
Ever happy and calm,<br />
Like a fruit with a worm,<br />
My life had a storm.<br />
<br />
Navigating at all cost,<br />
I found myself lost.<br />
All the aims I dreamed,<br />
Many got shipwrecked.<br />
<br />
I dig my thoughts deep,<br />
On many nights I weep,<br />
In that pain I became cold,<br />
Unrelenting and bold.<br />
<br />
Amidst all deception,<br />
I saw a conclusion.<br />
The ridings were rough,<br />
The tidings were tough.<br />
<br />
Without any digress,<br />
I worked for progress,<br />
My life turned around,<br />
It became pretty sound.<br />
<br />
Amidst all the laughter,<br />
There was a missing chapter,<br />
That's when I saw you,<br />
My heart beats for you.<br />
<br />
A feeling so gentle,<br />
It blossomed to kindle,<br />
I fancied a big duet,<br />
And I became a poet.<br />
<br />
Oh, Gulmohar flower,<br />
With your witty fervour,<br />
Please don't kill me!<br />
Please don't hang me!<br />
<br />
I mustered up my courage,<br />
After days of forage,<br />
And gave you a flower,<br />
For you to be my lover.<br />
<br />
My heart stood like a rock,<br />
Feelings I had felt a block,<br />
I realised that you're a wall,<br />
Built on rocks strong and tall.<br />
<br />
I thought you'd say yes,<br />
And never did I guess,<br />
You would say no,<br />
My guts said so.<br />
<br />
I accepted in grace,<br />
And gave you some space,<br />
But I stayed in touch,<br />
My feelings held in a clutch.<br />
<br />
In the distance I admired,<br />
What your heart desired,<br />
Watched your subtle grace,<br />
The thoughts you embrace.<br />
<br />
Amidst a turbulent time,<br />
My heart did rhyme,<br />
And longed to say your name,<br />
And stir a passionate flame.<br />
<br />
With patience, I waited,<br />
My thoughts seated,<br />
Having tested time,<br />
Hoping your heart be mine.<br />
<br />
I gathered a lot of courage,<br />
Than what I could forage,<br />
I knocked on the door again,<br />
Despite the pouring rain.<br />
<br />
The door didn't budge,<br />
Not even a nudge,<br />
But I gained a trust,<br />
Firm and robust.<br />
<br />
I saw a glimpse,<br />
The thoughts you eclipse,<br />
A glimpse of many years,<br />
Sum of many fears.<br />
<br />
I saw you up-close,<br />
You're beautiful prose!<br />
Many ups and downs,<br />
Echoing many sounds.<br />
<br />
What can I honestly say?<br />
If you don't feel that way?<br />
I can't force you to sway,<br />
But it's hard to move away!<br />
<br />
In the moments I feel sad,<br />
Your thoughts drive me mad.<br />
With my feelings unclad,<br />
I felt terrible and bad.<br />
<br />
I prayed to the universe,<br />
For you to find your verse,<br />
For many a laurel,<br />
And friends so loyal.<br />
<br />
With a heavy heart,<br />
I take a fresh start,<br />
I have been so hard,<br />
On myself and scarred.<br />
<br />
You did not feel that way,<br />
After all, I had to say,<br />
Though my heart is in a sway,<br />
I decided to move away.<br />
<br />
I see my heart in pain,<br />
Of injuries deep and plain,<br />
I drift away to heal,<br />
And many voids to seal.<br />
<br />
I sail away far and wide,<br />
I have many waves to ride,<br />
I am always a riser,<br />
I keep growing wiser.<br />
<br />
If you feel for me later,<br />
Do write a big letter,<br />
Come out and take a walk,<br />
Let's meet out and talk.</div>
