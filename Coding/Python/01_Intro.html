<h1 id="introduction-to-python">Introduction to Python</h1>
<p>Python is a programming language written by Dutch Programmer Guido
van Rossum. Python as of 2019, is one of the most commonly used
programming languages, having its reach expanded to a variety of
fields.</p>
<p>Learning Python can be quite useful for a variety of purposes. So, it
is quite recommended.</p>
<h2 id="features-of-python">Features of Python</h2>
<p>Python programming language has a lot of features that make in
versatile.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-an-interpreted-programming-language.">It is an Interpreted
Programming Language.</h3>
<p>What this means is that each and every line of code written by the
programmer is interpreted into its corresponding machine or assembly
level programming immediately and executed immediately. The advantage of
this kind of architecture is that the programmer can see if his/her code
is working well on a line-by-line basis and execute each and every line
on their own. So, this architecture is user-friendly to work with.
However, this method is inefficient when it comes to using resources.
Hence, the speed of execution is quite slow, often taking anywhere
between 2-200+ times the speed of a code written in a compiled
programming language like C or C++ for the same purpose. However, one of
the pragmatic reasons such interpreted languages exist is because such
languages are easier to learn and get things done on the fly. In
comparison to compiled programming languages, the development time to
generate a program for some purposes is quite small. So in a trade-off
between Development time versus Execution time, if Execution time is not
a big bother, speed is not a major requirement, and the freedom to run
commands on the fly is more important, then in such places, Python and
other interpreted programming languages are the clear winner. Learning
programming using python or interpreted programming language is a
gentler way to introduce people into programming by concentrating on the
end goal without worrying about the specifics.</p>
<p>Just for an example, look at the simple <code>hello, world</code>
program looks like in <code>Java</code> - a compiled programming
language vs <code>Python</code> - an interpreted programming language.
The simplicity you see with Python is quite evident. Granted, this is a
simple program and it might look like this example is nitpicked.
However, when a programmer tries to write a program in a compiled
programming language versus any other interpreted language, the latter
one will usually look simpler and easy to read.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre

<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span> </span></code></pre></div>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="co"># This is a simple &quot;Hello, world&quot; program written in Python</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&quot;Hello, world&quot;</span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In contrast to this, we have compiled programming languages like C,
C++, Java etc., in which the entire program gets converted into machine
or assembly level programming at the end and executed together. This
makes compiled programming languages fast and quite efficient. However,
the architecture is not user-friendly. You don’t have the freedom to run
each and every line one-by-one. So, this makes the programming difficult
for the programmer. For the purpose of speed and efficiency, compiled
programming languages take the cake by a land-slide. If execution time
has to be as small as possible, and programming resources such as
availability of processors, memory are of vital importance, then in
these situations the compiled programming languages win. These reasons
enable them to be used as the foundations of interpreted programming
languages and even the architectures of operating systems. Due to the
complexities involved, learning programming using such compiled
programming languages is a harder way to introduce people to learn
programming languages by enforcing the need for good programming
practices and systematic thinking.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-a-general-purpose-programming-language">It is a general
purpose programming language</h3>
<p>What this means is that the programming language can be used for a
variety of purposes. Most programming languages can be used only for one
or two applications. For instance, C, C++, are used for making OS and
software. They are also used for scientific computation.</p>
<p>Python is developed in such a manner that it can be used for any sort
of programming. It can be used as a teaching tool, as a programming
language for scientific computation, for web development, for making
software, for making websites, etc., With time, the number of
applications for the language will keep on increasing.</p>
<p>Infact, the creator of Python, Guido van Rossum intended and created
Python for the same reason: to be able to be used by anyone for any
purpose.</p>
<h3 id="it-is-object-oriented">It is object oriented</h3>
<p>What this means is that the entire language is built on the concept
of objects. In the context of a programming language, an object is an
entity that has some data or information with it along with some
procedures that work on these data. These data are often known as
<code>attributes</code> and these procedures that work on these
<code>attributes</code> is often known as <code>methods</code>.</p>
<p>This feature can be quite difficult to comprehend for a beginner if
not explained correctly. However, in the long run, for a user who is
looking for better ways to handle data and make easier procedures, such
<code>objects</code> in the language prove quite useful.</p>
<p>As of now, the context is not well-established here to explain what
<code>objects</code> fully mean. It will be established and explained
quite well and in-detail in the subsequent pages.</p>
<h3 id="the-design-of-the-language-is-simple">The design of the language
is simple</h3>
<p>The core philosophy of python is to make the programming experience
simple for anyone who uses it. To summarize the philosophy behind the
language in the best possible way, the Python Enhancement Proposal 20 -
shortly known as <a
href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/">PEP-20</a> has a set of
19 instructions listed down in the document - <a
href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/"><em>The Zen of
Python</em></a>. To access this set of instructions, all one has to do
is type the command:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3"><pre
class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="im">import</span> this</span></code></pre></div>
<p>… in the terminal to get the instructions as shown.</p>
<pre><code>The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren&#39;t special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you&#39;re Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it&#39;s a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let&#39;s do more of those!</code></pre>
<h2 id="why-python">Why Python?</h2>
<p>If you were to ask me “why should I learn Python when there are many
many languages out there?” - I’ll simply list-out the following
details.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple to use,</li>
<li>Free and Open Source,</li>
<li>High Level Programming Language,</li>
<li>Fast to learn and implement,</li>
<li>Interoperatability with the linux and unix operating systems,</li>
<li>Interoperatability with other programming languages,</li>
<li>Used for General Purpose Programming, Software Development, GUI, Web
Design, Scientific Computation, OS etc.,</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="is-it-undisputed">Is it undisputed?</h2>
<p>By telling all the good parts of the language, It might seem that
Python is an undisputed language triumphing over other languages.</p>
<p>To answer the question, No! Python has its own fair share of
advantages and disadvantages. Infact, every language has it’s ups and
downs. Python is not a perfect programming language.</p>
<h2 id="different-versions-of-python">Different Versions of Python</h2>
<p>As of 2019, there are two versions of the Python Language: The Legacy
2.x series and the future 3.x series. Python 3.x came to existence
because the founder of Python, Guido van Rossum wanted to add more
features to the language. The problem was that adding those features
meant dismantling the major framework of Python 2.x and rewrite a
significant portion of the language. Consequently, to make sure that the
already exisiting programs work well and to make sure the new features
get implemented, the old version of python, namely 2.x remained as it is
for backward compatibility, while the newer version of python namely 3.x
has the new features added to it.</p>
<p>The result of this decision is the exisitence of 2 distinct versions
of python with a lot of similarities on the top, with many differences
underneath.</p>
<h3 id="python-2---legacy">Python 2 - Legacy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Old version of Python</li>
<li>Legacy Codes built on it</li>
<li>No new version anymore</li>
<li>Library Migration going on</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="python-3---future">Python 3 - Future</h3>
<ul>
<li>Newer version of Python</li>
<li>The future of Python</li>
<li>Revamped internal architecture - supports future technological
implementations</li>
<li>(Almost all) libraries are translated</li>
</ul>
<p>We are in the <strong>transition</strong> period wherein we have
access to use both the versions of Python. In the future, Python 2 will
be obsolete, and in this transition period, almost all the libraries are
being converted from Python 2 to Python 3. Infact, new libraries are
being made in Python 3 extensively.</p>
<p>Consequently, as of 2019, Python 2.x series is stopping all major
releases and releasing only sub releases for maintenance purposes. Other
than that, the most active development is focussed on Python 3. The
support and maintenance is only for people to transition from python 2.x
to 3.x soon.</p>
<h2 id="which-one-should-i-use">Which one should I use?</h2>
<p>If you’re a beginner, do not worry about python 2.x. Go ahead with
learning python from 3.x series. If you already have worked with Python
2 for a while, then you can still use python 2, but do transition to
python 3 soon to get all the features.</p>
