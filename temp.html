<h1 id="a-sweet-voyage">A Sweet Voyage</h1>
<div class="line-block">I thought about the day when we first met,<br />
It is not so vivid; the details were blurry,<br />
But the feelings we felt, were crystal clear,<br />
We didn't realise, the sweet voyage ahead.<br />
<br />
It wasn't a beginning, as in a fairy tale,<br />
It is quite common, but still feels special.<br />
Both did think, that we might drift away,<br />
Yet I stayed back, and so did you.<br />
<br />
Despite the journeys and paths we travelled,<br />
We had a lot of ideas in common,<br />
The patience to nurture, a robust, powerful bond,<br />
A passion for making a difference in the world.<br />
<br />
A loyalty so strong, it stands tall against any crisis,<br />
The drive to help the other, when the other is lost,<br />
A sense of justice, and what's right and wrong,<br />
A shared flavour for humour and ideas boundless.<br />
<br />
When lost in thoughts and plans for the world,<br />
One became the teacher the other the student,<br />
You taught me a lot, and I taught you too,<br />
Both helped each other, to find our inner selves.<br />
<br />
What events will life throw, I have no clue,<br />
But amidst all that is variable, there is one constant,<br />
That for me is your valuable friendship,<br />
That I shall do my best to preserve till the end.</div>
