Agree to Disagree
=================

| The world around us is not as simple as it seems,
| Rarely it happens, just like our dreams.
| For there are events, that are not in our hand,
| Factors that are plenty, like the grains of sand.
| 
| It is hard to keep going, all the time so strong,
| When the choices we made, can go wrong.
| Life is not so simple, and painted black and white,
| It is messy and twisted, and hardly you are right.
| 
| Even when facts are strong, you can go wrong,
| And there is more to tell, about the tale so long.
| There is always a limit, for you to comprehend,
| Beyond that it is dubious, built on intend.
| 
| We all look at events, and incidents in life,
| And gather bit and pieces, and end up in strife,
| For you would like to think, that you are quite right,
| And me to be so wrong, to miss the truth in sight.
| 
| All the bits we have, are parts of a bigger puzzle,
| Although it seems perfect, it is in a tousle.
| Sometimes you\'re lucky, to get the right piece,
| Otherwise unfortunate, to find the wrong piece.
| 
| In the world full of paint, in shades of grey,
| Which shade is right, is quite hard to say.
| You picked a shade, with a certain degree,
| If it doesn\'t suit others, agree to disagree.
