Lessons from Entropy
====================

| We, mortals, dream for order and peace,
| But nature has its own rules and laws.
| Laws that seem to favour order at first,
| Still, in the end, favours chaos and disarray.
| 
| Swimming upstream against the mighty river,
| We expend our energy to maintain our order.
| For if we don't expend the river will sweep through,
| Even the universe sails on Entropy.
| 
| We little mortals in our briefest of existence,
| Have such audacity to play the role of God,
| Forgetting the fact that we are mere dust,
| Who shouts in despair that we are special.
| 
| We are nothing but mere guests to the cosmos,
| While our visit is short, let's live in harmony.
| Entropy is the enemy, and the enemy never loses,
| Still, we must fight, and perhaps that's all we need.
| 
| While our existence is special to us in myriad ways,
| We are randomness in the ripples of space and time.
| That is a cold truth and an inconvenient one,
| While it is depressing, it is oddly liberating.
| 
| In our delusions to defy nature and its rules,
| We tend to cause more harm than good.
| While we do evolve and change for the better,
| The price we pay often is disruption and pain.
| 
| As we grow old and realise the difference we made,
| It is often too late, and you can't undo the damage.
| And time is a slave for the ever-increasing Entropy,
| And it does not allow us, to undo our wrongs.
| 
| Break the delusions before you can't realise,
| Realise it before you lose your gift to learn,
| Learn before you become resistant to change,
| Change before it is already too late.
