**Quick tip: You can view the source code of the webpage inside a web browser. Also, there are developer tools in Chrome (press ``F12``) (console, elements tab, etc.,) that are particularly useful while developing webpages to look at the various parts of the webpage and also to catch errors while using and running JavaScript and or PHP code**
