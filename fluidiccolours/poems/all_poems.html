            <div class="inner align-justify">
                <h1 id="acceptance">Acceptance</h1>
<div class="line-block">In times of uncertainty,<br />
I clutched tightly to the past,<br />
In fear of the unknown,<br />
For the comfort of the known.<br />
<br />
As I look at the future,<br />
I see my shadows of the past,<br />
I look at my hands,<br />
I see the scars of holding on too long.<br />
<br />
In a fortunate mishap,<br />
One string detached from my past,<br />
Rather than fear, I felt lighter,<br />
And my journey became easier,<br />
<br />
I made mistakes, and I can't erase them,<br />
I can only learn, and move on,<br />
Learn to drop the burden of the past,<br />
Wisen with age, more accepting of the unknown.</div>
<h1 id="a-farewell-in-melancholy">A Farewell in Melancholy</h1>
<div class="line-block">As the night gathers, I compose for this special day,<br />
A day to reminisce, a day to cherish.<br />
Had I not chosen this path, where would I be this day?<br />
Would I be in this place? Or would I perish?<br />
<br />
With a heavy heart, amidst joy and sadness,<br />
I look back, with less-tinted glasses.<br />
I lingered on, to every fleeting moment,<br />
Wished to capture, every little movement.<br />
<br />
The days of happiness, the nights of liveliness.<br />
The days of sadness, the nights of loneliness.<br />
All the nocturnal musings, journeys and memories,<br />
The never-ending vagaries of the world and reveries.<br />
<br />
The wild heart, beaming with love.<br />
The broken heart, plunging into sadness.<br />
The prideful heart, glowing with hope.<br />
The fallen heart, spiralling into madness.<br />
<br />
Had I not chosen this path, where would I be this day?<br />
I'll never know, but I am proud I did!.<br />
Would I be in this place? Or would I perish?<br />
I'll never know, but I am proud I did!.<br />
<br />
As I sit here, I pray to the Universe,<br />
For a life of happiness, etched as a verse.<br />
With longer summers, and shorter winters,<br />
Painted in the colours of Autumn and Spring.</div>
<h1 id="a-farewell-song">A Farewell Song</h1>
<div class="line-block">You came here long back,<br />
And helped us all grow.<br />
Are we ready to fill your shoes?<br />
Although grown, we don't know!<br />
<br />
We'll miss your soft voice,<br />
The calm presence most of all.<br />
A dance of grace and brains,<br />
Filled with abundant maturity.<br />
<br />
Though we are young, we will remember,<br />
The lessons you taught us forever.<br />
We will miss you, with all our heart,<br />
Although we smile, our hearts feel a void.<br />
<br />
Your ship has come, for you to sail,<br />
A new chapter begins, in your new voyage.<br />
We wish you all the best, for your journey ahead!<br />
This is just comma; our lives will meet again!</div>
<h1 id="agree-to-disagree">Agree to Disagree</h1>
<div class="line-block">The world around us, is not simple as it seems,<br />
Rarely it happens, just like our dreams.<br />
For there are events, that are not in our hand,<br />
Factors that are plenty, like the grains of sand.<br />
<br />
It is hard to keep going, all the time so strong,<br />
When the choices we made, can go wrong.<br />
Life is not so simple, and painted black and white,<br />
It is messy and twisted, and hardly you are right.<br />
<br />
Even when facts are strong, you can go wrong,<br />
And there is more to tell, about the tale so long.<br />
There is always a limit, for you to comprehend,<br />
Beyond that it is dubious, builded on intend.<br />
<br />
We all look at events, and incidents in life,<br />
And gather bit and pieces, and end up in a strife,<br />
For you would like to think, that you are quite right,<br />
And me to be so wrong, to miss the truth in sight.<br />
<br />
All the bits we have, are parts of a bigger puzzle,<br />
Although seems perfect, it is in a tousel.<br />
Sometimes you're lucky, to get the right piece,<br />
Otherwise unfortunate, to find the wrong piece.<br />
<br />
In the world that is painted, in shades of grey,<br />
Which shade is right, is quite hard to say.<br />
You picked a shade, with a certain degree,<br />
If it doesn't suit others, just agree to disagree.</div>
<h1 id="a-riders-journey">A Rider's Journey</h1>
<div class="line-block">Oh, mighty road! Take him to new places!<br />
He has enough fuel, to lit all his dreams.<br />
<br />
Ask yourself during your journeys,<br />
What does your heart want?<br />
While the roads lead to new places,<br />
Follow your heart, your true GPS!<br />
<br />
The roads ahead have many stories.<br />
Many new faces and many sweet memories.<br />
Pull the throttle, and put on your helmet,<br />
Take a ride, and leave a trail!<br />
<br />
Keep travelling as always, as the roads are plenty.<br />
In the journey of life, getting lost is okay.<br />
But never forget to keep riding,<br />
To keep riding with all your heart!<br />
The journey on the outside will help you,<br />
Find your true self on the inside!</div>
<h1 id="a-song-of-blue-and-yellow">A Song of Blue and Yellow</h1>
<div class="line-block">On a rainless day,<br />
We push and pull,<br />
Under the clouds,<br />
Our mischief begins,<br />
<br />
You were simple,<br />
My ego told before,<br />
But you are a puzzle,<br />
I realise baffled,<br />
<br />
Are you my enemy?<br />
Are you my friend?<br />
Why do you love me?<br />
And hate me together?<br />
<br />
Torn between poles I stand,<br />
Lost like a raindrop in the sky,<br />
I swing between joy and sorrow,<br />
Clueless of the morrow.<br />
<br />
Should I leave? Or should I stay?<br />
You tell me, my dear,<br />
For the trauma of the poison of past<br />
Don't fear the elixir of future.<br />
<br />
You are the ray of hope,<br />
Who flashed in my starless sky,<br />
Adding your shades of vibrant yellow<br />
To my life filled with mystic blue,<br />
<br />
Hold my hand and fly with me,<br />
The sky is vast and endless,<br />
Cherishing your love, I shall pen,<br />
A Song of Blue and yellow.</div>
<h1 id="a-sweet-voyage">A Sweet Voyage</h1>
<div class="line-block">I thought about the day when we first met,<br />
It is not so vivid, the details were blurry,<br />
But the feelings we felt, were crystal clear,<br />
We didn't realise, the sweet voyage ahead.<br />
<br />
It wasn't a beginning, as in a fairy tale,<br />
It is quite common, but still feels special.<br />
Both did think, that we might drift away,<br />
Yet I stayed back, and so did you.<br />
<br />
Despite the journeys and paths we travelled,<br />
We had a lot of ideals in common,<br />
The patience to nurture, a strong powerful bond,<br />
A passion to make a difference in the world.<br />
<br />
A loyalty so strong, it stands tall against crisis,<br />
The drive to help the other, when the other is lost,<br />
A sense of justice, and what's right and wrong,<br />
A shared flavour for humour and ideas boundless.<br />
<br />
When lost in thoughts and plans for the world,<br />
One became the teacher the other the student,<br />
You taught me a lot, and I taught you too,<br />
Both helped each other, to find our innerselves.<br />
<br />
What events will life throw, I have no clue,<br />
But amidst all that is variable, there is one constant,<br />
That for me is your valuable friendship,<br />
That I shall do my best to preserve till the end.</div>
<h1 id="autumn-colours">Autumn Colours</h1>
<div class="line-block">You come today, and the sun became truant,<br />
Your winds do bring, the scent of the ground.<br />
In all of the summer, I played my heart's content,<br />
With your cool touch, you made me retreat.<br />
<br />
Why are you sad?, I always do ponder,<br />
Whenever you come, you cry your heart out.<br />
The days of dampness, dark and gloomy,<br />
The falling leaves, and vibrant colours.<br />
<br />
You are a mother, to this curious child,<br />
And just like you, I keep changing.<br />
Many keep saying, that you are a fall,<br />
To me, you're necessary, the force of balance.<br />
<br />
As I sit near the window, I see your tears flow down,<br />
A strange wonder and awe fill my inner heart.<br />
You made me sit and travel dimensions with books,<br />
For that I am grateful, and I can never repay you!</div>
<h1 id="bane-of-trying">Bane of Trying</h1>
<div class="line-block">Sitting calm and quiet, you hear the universe speak,<br />
Of all the plans it has, for you quite sleek.<br />
If what you sow, is what you actually reap,<br />
Will it all come true? All the dreams in your sleep?<br />
<br />
Trying to make hay, while the sun is shining,<br />
You put all efforts, hoping for a silver lining.<br />
While it is true, that time waits for none,<br />
If you're hurt and broken, can anything be won?<br />
<br />
Somethings in life, are not so straight,<br />
You might have to, just sit and wait.<br />
You cannot plant a seed, today and be ready to reap,<br />
All the harvest tomorrow, and keep them in a heap.<br />
<br />
Like the wet clay a potter, uses to make pottery,<br />
Things will take shape, as if it's a sorcery.<br />
Yet even the pots made, need some time to dry,<br />
For that you must wait, and keep a watchful eye.<br />
<br />
Rushing the steps fast, or pushing it too hard,<br />
You might kill the very thing, you seek so hard.<br />
There is some wisdom, in moving slow and steady,<br />
When the stars align, you will be quite ready.<br />
<br />
You might get what you seek, when you try very hard,<br />
But when you are not ready, retaining it is very hard.<br />
You'll miss little things, while trying without waiting,<br />
The restlessness is the price, the bane of trying.</div>
<h1 id="behind-the-smile">Behind the Smile</h1>
<div class="line-block">When life hits you hard,<br />
Breaks your heart into shards,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
When things are hopeless<br />
And you are clueless,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
When the odds do not favour,<br />
You persist with fervour,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
When you have the courage,<br />
To rise against the discourage,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
You know you're vincible,<br />
But giving up is impossible,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
You fear because you're wise,<br />
You hide it in disguise,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
When you're truly scared,<br />
But persist facing the feared,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
The smile you put shall hide,<br />
All the pain on the inside,<br />
But it is needed to move onward,<br />
The needed courage to go forward.<br />
<br />
Though the smile is fake,<br />
It keeps the hope awake.<br />
It's easy to smile when nothing is at a loss,<br />
Can you smile when everything is at a loss?<br />
<br />
I can smile despite having nothing,<br />
I learnt to smile losing everything.<br />
That surprises people,<br />
And it amazes me too.</div>
<h1 id="being-brave">Being Brave</h1>
<div class="line-block">In the tides of life,<br />
It was easier to conform.<br />
But the more I did,<br />
I started losing my soul,<br />
<br />
When your calling is genuine,<br />
And your purpose adds joy to the cosmos,<br />
Why should you settle for the plain,<br />
When you can reach for the summit?<br />
<br />
Even when the one you seek is lost,<br />
There is valour in trying, and it is endearing.<br />
A closure that you gave your heart,<br />
Instead of admitting failure by default.<br />
<br />
You're the child of a star, born to shine,<br />
Go higher and higher till your heart's content,<br />
When the whole wide world is your Oyster,<br />
Why should you settle for the dust?</div>
<h1 id="blessed">Blessed</h1>
<div class="line-block">How many journeys have I voyaged before?<br />
In all the lives before?<br />
How many journeys will I voyage after?<br />
In all the lives after?<br />
<br />
I have no count, nor can I keep one,<br />
For my past lives are histories,<br />
Written on scrolls, dried and decayed,<br />
Powdered and lost in the dust.<br />
<br />
I have no count, nor can I keep one,<br />
For my future lives are mysteries,<br />
Waiting to be written, and make a mark,<br />
On the vast flowing river of time.<br />
<br />
Amidst the past and the future,<br />
Lies my present - my great gift,<br />
With parts of my journey written and tracked,<br />
With parts of my journey waiting to be marked.<br />
<br />
I am but a hollow vessel,<br />
Whose existence is mere happenstance,<br />
In the grand scheme of the universe,<br />
I am but an insignificant stardust<br />
<br />
With your touch I found purpose,<br />
This hollow vessel became a flute.<br />
With the life breath, you infused in me,<br />
My soul resonated, and music came out.<br />
<br />
If I am insignificant, then why do I feel,<br />
Your indomitable presence in my soul?<br />
In those instances, when you bless me,<br />
I feel like a child, born to rule the skies.<br />
<br />
The music that came out from my soul,<br />
As it flew across valleys and hills,<br />
Resonated and resonated with every living soul,<br />
All at once, in a grand unison.<br />
<br />
Whenever I felt lost and empty,<br />
You answered my prayers and shared your breath.<br />
I lost count you filled my soul,<br />
Yet you keep giving, again and again.<br />
<br />
With every gift, my melodies became sweet,<br />
It grew strong and diverse and deep,<br />
Although my heart, though quite finite in size,<br />
It fully felt your blessings, quite infinite in size.<br />
<br />
My joy knew no bounds nor any limits,<br />
Whenever I was blessed, the feeling was ineffable,<br />
 Unknown to me, despite the countless melodies,<br />
There was room, in my heart to sing more.<br />
<br />
Years shall pass, and I shall get weak,<br />
Sticks and stones can break my bones,<br />
But I shall stay strong and make melodies,<br />
I am blessed by your sacred touch.</div>
<h1 id="blusing-bride">Blusing Bride</h1>
<div class="line-block">As the day nears, my heart overflows with joy,<br />
My eyes express shyness, my lips speak my happiness,<br />
This was a day I dreamt, right from a tender age,<br />
I am glad it is happening, a day of new beginnings,<br />
<br />
My little heart is restless, swinging between joys and dreams,<br />
Even when I am afar, my eyes keep looking at you,<br />
I savour your charm, from the corner of my eyes,<br />
And reciprocate the love, you always showed on me,<br />
<br />
When I am alone, my heart yearns your touch,<br />
Your gentle caress strokes my inner soul,<br />
When we dance, the moon turns pink,<br />
The birds will forever sing, our love for aeons,<br />
<br />
When the darkness prevails, our story shall begin,<br />
Help me pen a tale; even the angels can’t recite,<br />
Recite your vows; I am ready with mine,<br />
Let’s hold our hands, as husband and wife.</div>
<h1 id="breaking-rules">Breaking Rules</h1>
<div class="line-block">I was young, naive and bold,<br />
With many rules, as my stronghold.<br />
Rules that kept me moving,<br />
Rules that kept me improving.<br />
<br />
As I grew old, I grew less naive,<br />
The trials in life, filtered me like a sieve,<br />
These rules and these regulations,<br />
Became my many invalid foundations.<br />
<br />
How do you feel, about your life?<br />
When your heart is cut, with a knife?<br />
These rules, once kept me safe,<br />
As they outdated, I was attacked by a strafe.<br />
<br />
After many a night, losing faith,<br />
All the memories flashed like a wraith.<br />
The rules once I built are not valid,<br />
Excessively rigid and incessantly pallid.<br />
<br />
Pondering on these thoughts, I do wonder,<br />
If I had treated, myself a bit kinder?<br />
Hindsight told me, I would be happy,<br />
Much more calm, and much less grumpy.<br />
<br />
As I venture further, I am treating myself kind,<br />
No more to the days, I was stuck in a bind.<br />
Breaking my many invalid rules,<br />
I am beginning to see life jewels!</div>
<h1 id="brida">Brida</h1>
<div class="line-block">With a backpack in hand,<br />
She travels the vast land,<br />
Lover of mother nature,<br />
Whose bond you'll nurture.<br />
<br />
A free and untied spirit,<br />
With unquestionable merit.<br />
When happy she is chatty,<br />
When tempted she is flirty.<br />
<br />
In magic, she believes,<br />
Admiration, she receives.<br />
Quite broken by the past,<br />
Yet she is not lost.<br />
<br />
A teller of great stories,<br />
Visiting many territories.<br />
Her journey is very long,<br />
To make her happy tag along.<br />
<br />
A seeker of connection,<br />
Pondering on life's reflections.<br />
Bold and beautiful soul,<br />
She strives to reach her goal.<br />
<br />
An unrelenting integrity,<br />
Ruthless to the nitty gritty.<br />
Yet she has a kind face,<br />
Walking with a stylish grace.</div>
<h1 id="childish-dreams">Childish Dreams</h1>
<div class="line-block">With one little leap,<br />
I want to touch the sky,<br />
As I caress the leaves,<br />
The plants should blossom,<br />
<br />
With my smile, I'll win the world,<br />
Fly high and kiss the moon,<br />
My heart is heavy with desires,<br />
With no care for the future,<br />
<br />
I closed my eyes lying on a chair,<br />
And I wake up in the morning on a bed,<br />
With a friendly fight, I win foes,<br />
With my charm, I mend broken hearts,<br />
<br />
I change style like the clouds that float,<br />
But my heart remains pure and pristine,<br />
A strange innocence, hope, and love,<br />
I'll spread and share to the world around.</div>
<h1 id="choices-and-chances">Choices and Chances</h1>
<div class="line-block">It happened randomly, they all write,<br />
As if the universe, conspired to make them meet.<br />
It is an Illusion, is all it is,<br />
Only a little truth, that's all there is.<br />
<br />
If love is random and happens by chance,<br />
Will it matter if you try it or not?<br />
What shall be, the difference it makes?<br />
For those who pursue, and pour in their soul?<br />
<br />
Love you are, a mystical enigma!<br />
Despite a million tales, you are still elusive!<br />
Source of awe, wonder, and peace,<br />
Reason for disgust, disaster, and violence.<br />
<br />
You happen to many, at precarious times,<br />
Breaking their hearts, and tainting their souls.<br />
You happen, for some in odd times,<br />
And thrive and flourish, in ways never thought.<br />
<br />
For some who seek, they get tested to the core,<br />
For some, you come, taking their breath away.<br />
For some who seek, end up all alone,<br />
For some you come, at the right moments.<br />
<br />
You tempt us all, with all that is rosy,<br />
Showing us the tales, of many twin flames.<br />
That's not the way; it happens to all,<br />
Some who believe it, they break and fall.<br />
<br />
You make two souls meet, who are fitting pieces,<br />
The flower doesn't blossom, and sees the day,<br />
You make two souls meet, who are unfit pieces,<br />
The flower blossoms, rots, and withers.<br />
<br />
You make two souls meet, who are fitting pieces,<br />
For one it blossoms, for the other it doesn't,<br />
And make the bloomers wonder, what's this sorcery?<br />
Left with no answer, forced to find closure.<br />
<br />
For some it happens, gradual and natural,<br />
From unknown to friends to buddies to sweethearts.<br />
Blurring the lines gracefully and smooth,<br />
Nurtured and built, with time and space.<br />
<br />
For some it happens, as if a fairy tale,<br />
With many intimate moments, and many fantasies,<br />
It ends bitter, like a quenched hot steel,<br />
The heart does shatter, like broken glass.<br />
<br />
Not all your tales have a happy ending.<br />
Not all those who found you, cherish you till the end.<br />
Some end what is theirs, for greener pastures,<br />
While some change a lot, they don't fit anymore.<br />
<br />
It is a tragedy to see, a good broken heart,<br />
A heart once full of hopes, stitching its pieces.<br />
Filled with pain, and walls so high,<br />
Scared to trust, and cautious than before.<br />
<br />
It is sad to see, a good heart so lonely,<br />
A heart that yearns, for the joys of intimacy.<br />
Feeling low and cold, and learning from falls,<br />
Trying hard to be strong, despite the let downs.<br />
<br />
Are you that fickle? That you happen by chance?<br />
And you are fragile, tender yet dangerous.<br />
Are you so chaotic? That you are unpredictable?<br />
After making us win, you break us to be humble?<br />
<br />
Despite the turbulence, you bring forth,<br />
And amidst the chaos, you show us an order.<br />
Despite the shipwrecks, you show us some joy,<br />
Making our lives hard, with or without you.<br />
<br />
The stars do align, for some people proper,<br />
With time and space, everything falls in place.<br />
For some they make, the stars to align,<br />
For they can't wait, as you never visited them.<br />
<br />
It takes courage, to fall in love hard,<br />
To fall so madly, and fall so deeply.<br />
It takes even more, to pick your shattered heart,<br />
And stitch it back in place, and move on.<br />
<br />
It takes strength to stay strong, and keep going on,<br />
To find The One you yearned, all the way long.<br />
Swimming up the river, against the cross-currents,<br />
Trying not to drown, in the stream of life.<br />
<br />
All the love that formed, out of lies and disguise,<br />
May start well at first, but it will break off.<br />
Not long can you wear, a skin different from yours,<br />
At the core of it lies, all the issues in disguise.<br />
<br />
Love once happened can wither with time as well,<br />
And it can boom back, with the same soul or other.<br />
A love formed of truth, built with trust and kindness,<br />
With passion and maturity, is deep and beautiful.<br />
<br />
You do get to choose, whom you'll fall in love,<br />
For reasons right or wrong, the choice is all yours.<br />
Welcome to the real world, it is blurry and grey,<br />
And love is quite messy, yet you want it anyway.</div>
<h1 id="concede">Concede</h1>
<div class="line-block">You're running all day, in the pursuit of success,<br />
You march ahead strong, without any digress,<br />
You're certain you'll win, for you it's obvious,<br />
While there are many factors, totally oblivious.<br />
<br />
When ideas become real, your faith gets checked,<br />
You either set sail, or get beaten and shipwrecked!<br />
When the journey goes smooth, you sing a song,<br />
When the tides go rough, you think what went wrong!<br />
<br />
It is quite tragic, when the winter winds blow,<br />
For no fault of yours, life gets cold and slow.<br />
It is quite splintering, when you do mistakes,<br />
For all the fault is yours, you lose all the stakes.<br />
<br />
Your strength is not seen, when you have everything,<br />
It is seen quite well, when you can't get anything!<br />
It is not in arrogance, that refuses shamefully,<br />
It is in the humility, to concede gracefully.<br />
<br />
It is human to error, and we all are imperfect,<br />
It is a fallacy to believe, that you are quite perfect!<br />
It takes courage to be strong, and pursue a goal,<br />
And much much more, to mend your shattered soul.<br />
<br />
It takes strength to concede, and change your way,<br />
Muster all the courage, and redefine your say.<br />
Having tasted defeat, you're not scared to play,<br />
Or change your game, while travelling midway!</div>
<h1 id="cursed">Cursed</h1>
<div class="line-block">In the eerie quiet night, I hear your heartbreak,<br />
Echoing loud and clear, deafening my solitude,<br />
It was my fault; I let you near me,<br />
I thought I was ready; I felt we could make it,<br />
<br />
There is a void in my soul, where you once stayed,<br />
A pit so deep, even an abyss feels small,<br />
A void so old, and so very cold,<br />
I feel numb, and I feel lost,<br />
<br />
Many people afar, told me I was cold,<br />
When they came near, they told me I am warm,<br />
I warned them not to come, anymore near me,<br />
They came closer, and I burnt their dreams,<br />
<br />
I pray to the universe, to put me far away,<br />
For I am cursed, and my breath reeks death,<br />
I am sorry I hurt you, I care for you,<br />
This is a curse I can't, find a way to break.</div>
<h1 id="curse-of-being-strong">Curse of being strong</h1>
<div class="line-block">There were times, you were left all alone,<br />
Helpless and lost, with a heart of a stone.<br />
All you wanted, was a candle in the dark,<br />
All you got, was indifference quite stark.<br />
<br />
You pulled your socks up, and went for battle,<br />
Amidst all the voices, that tend to belittle.<br />
Burning the midnight oil, you continued to persist,<br />
Steadily and surely, you went through the mist.<br />
<br />
Now you got through, what was once quite rough,<br />
Now others look at you, as if you're quite tough.<br />
They all praise and sing, how strong you are,<br />
Unaware of the journey, and the perils so far.<br />
<br />
Now you are a beacon, for their hopes and dreams,<br />
Their whole life depends on you, they do scream!<br />
Asking you the gist, of your journey with disregard,<br />
Wanting the rosey road, instead of the road so hard.<br />
<br />
Treading the hard road, you became so strong,<br />
Learnt to find the truth, amidst all that is wrong.<br />
When you needed help, you got indifference,<br />
Now you asking help, makes no difference.<br />
<br />
The curse of being strong, is that you're left alone,<br />
To fight and fend your battles, all on your own.<br />
Very few shall relate, to the trials you went through,<br />
For you chose to move on, and see events through.</div>
<h1 id="dance-of-ecstasy">Dance of Ecstasy</h1>
<div class="line-block">As I went higher and higher, the troubles mattered less,<br />
In the struggle to climb, all my worries faded away,<br />
Sitting on the mountain, I see more than ever,<br />
The vast, broad landscapes, the bigger picture of life,<br />
<br />
As I sit and ponder, looking at my journey ahead,<br />
The path that leads to it gave me a scare,<br />
But the monsoon clouds, with its soft grey hands,<br />
Came closer to me, and embraced me with hope.<br />
<br />
The winds whispered, wishes in my ears,<br />
As it caressed my hair, it cooled my soul,<br />
In a moment of ecstasy, a queer liberation came,<br />
A child that never flew dared to rule the sky,<br />
<br />
On the ground I was doubtful, now I am clear,<br />
Like the peacocks in the monsoon rain, I too shall dance,<br />
As I keep climbing, I’ll go higher and higher,<br />
And all these sorrows, cannot break me forever.</div>
<h1 id="depression">Depression</h1>
<div class="line-block">In the calmest of nights, I prayed for peace,<br />
The peaceful silence became a scream,<br />
The blissful solitude became the worst of foes,<br />
The ever normal heart, beaten with insanity.<br />
<br />
They saw my wings, but didn't see the chains,<br />
I fought to break; I got torn instead,<br />
We all face it, they said in chorus,<br />
Having never suffered a void in their hearts,<br />
<br />
The nights filled with sleepless worries,<br />
My past demons dancing in my dreams,<br />
Selling your soul to get some sleep,<br />
You wake up empty, with disregard and apathy,<br />
<br />
A prisoner in your mind, you see the world real,<br />
Drowning in your sorrow, you cry for help,<br />
I don't want my grief to overflow to others,<br />
Said my heart in pain, as I sunk slowly into a grave.</div>
<h1 id="detached">Detached</h1>
<div class="line-block">I started to run,<br />
Even before I could walk,<br />
There were needs, and time was short.<br />
<br />
The farther I went,<br />
The finish line went even farther,<br />
I ran faster, yet nothing in sight.<br />
<br />
My feet bled, sore from pain,<br />
Everything else became a blur,<br />
I turn back, and I was all alone.<br />
<br />
Time went fast and slow,<br />
Days fleeted like minutes,<br />
Went a long way, still feel I've learnt none.<br />
<br />
Some of my dreams came true,<br />
But why do I feel so empty?<br />
And not a smile on my face?<br />
<br />
While I see others, running and happy,<br />
Can't help but feel raging envy.<br />
Why didn't it happen to me?<br />
<br />
Did I go wrong? Take a bad turn?<br />
Everything seems out of place.<br />
The irrational heart asked, why me?<br />
<br />
While I kept running, I forgot,<br />
To see the scenery, city, and people,<br />
The curse of never wandering.<br />
<br />
Am I the person I am?<br />
I feel like an alien to myself.<br />
Trapped in a world that speaks a foreign tongue.<br />
<br />
Trying to learn the rules of the game,<br />
It is such a mess and drives me insane.<br />
Feeling lost in this unending maze.<br />
<br />
Kept running all day, I lost track,<br />
Of other pursuits that keep life intact,<br />
For once I felt I was ready to enact.<br />
<br />
The setting was different, and things were subtle,<br />
I learnt the alphabets and tried to write,<br />
The settings wanted prose instead.<br />
<br />
It is hard to keep the embers burning,<br />
Realising my limits, yet pursuing,<br />
In an ever-changing world, detached.<br />
<br />
I will keep my embers burning bright,<br />
Forgo all the weight that pulled me back,<br />
And I shall pause for a while, here and there.<br />
<br />
Like the ball that sinks in water,<br />
Amidst all noise, I shall rise,<br />
For I have many promises to keep.</div>
<h1 id="excelsior">Excelsior!</h1>
<div class="line-block">A dreamer I am, I loved fantasy,<br />
For in its core, there is ecstasy,<br />
Many people say, some dreams are impossible,<br />
Till a soul like you comes, and makes it possible.<br />
<br />
Your art made me wonder, and warmed my heart,<br />
Many stories to ponder, with characters off the chart!<br />
You lived a life rich, and full of memories,<br />
Making my childhood sweet, with your great stories.<br />
<br />
Who shall be worthy? To fill your place?<br />
Thor can never find, a worthy one to replace!<br />
When Peter met Mary Jane, his heart skipped a beat,<br />
Will there be someone, to fill your seat?<br />
<br />
The legacy you leave, is insurmountable,<br />
The brilliance you showed, is unmeasurable!<br />
Till my heart beats, I shall always remember!<br />
The role you had in life, for eons together!</div>
<h1 id="feeling-infinite">Feeling Infinite</h1>
<div class="line-block">I was lost in space, wandering in time,<br />
Dwelling on the past, my future was blurred.<br />
In the depths of darkness, a ray of light emerged,<br />
A ray of bitter truth, a path of reconciliation.<br />
<br />
The shackles that bounded began to rust,<br />
My strength emerged, I broke free.<br />
The severed wings, once again sprouted,<br />
The freedom tasted sweet, happiness spouted.<br />
<br />
No more I am foolish; I have grown wise,<br />
Yet my smile was wide, as the broad blue sky.<br />
I chose to be kind, on myself more,<br />
I accepted what I can, and what I can't do.<br />
<br />
With a new found hope, I dived,<br />
The winds caressed my feathers, and I flew high.<br />
In that sweet moment, although I am finite,<br />
I felt strong to move on, and felt Infinite!</div>
<h1 id="festival-of-lights">Festival of Lights</h1>
<div class="line-block">On this epic day, were justice prevails,<br />
The light overcomes dark and persists,<br />
Nothing is great and fulfilling but,<br />
The warm company of kith and kin,<br />
<br />
Let the heavenly light gaze your homes,<br />
And spread its charm in all your lives,<br />
To all friends, family and all,<br />
A very Happy deepavali!</div>
<h1 id="fighting-life">Fighting Life</h1>
<div class="line-block">The journey of a man is always enigmatic,<br />
Through thick and thin a purpose is in need,<br />
While a few succeed and many fail bad,<br />
The river of life never stops for a break,<br />
<br />
The world is full of masked actors,<br />
With so many roles in so many plays,<br />
Masking and masking all life long<br />
Till there is nothing novel to share,<br />
<br />
The valiant mind is the biggest joke,<br />
For it goes on amidst a heavy storm,<br />
Through deserts and tides and thorny vines,<br />
Life is hardest for the strongest to go,<br />
<br />
In the quest of life, in search of a purpose,<br />
While many fail to stand against time,<br />
With broken bones and bloody knuckles,<br />
Life must move for the strongest of all,<br />
<br />
Let it be known that I am strong,<br />
Residing in winter and forging my spring,<br />
Deception, Evil, Pain or Grave,<br />
Nothing can break my Godly game!</div>
<h1 id="flamboyant-dance-of-a-phoenix">Flamboyant Dance of a Phoenix</h1>
<div class="line-block">Among the group there stood one,<br />
Unnoticed by the common ones,<br />
Who wanders around wide and far,<br />
Curious and kind, her nature by far,<br />
<br />
Full of hope and full of care,<br />
With a heart overflowing to dare,<br />
While people walk away with others,<br />
She spreads awe in a dance of colours,<br />
<br />
While I walked in a colourless planet,<br />
Minding my work and Winding my life,<br />
She flashed into my life as a sonnet,<br />
And changed my life with the dance,<br />
<br />
With her wings of majestic beauty,<br />
With feathers of red, green and blue,<br />
She made the calm sky brightly sunny,<br />
And none on this world didn’t have a clue,<br />
<br />
Who is she? The lovely little damsel?<br />
Whose mere existence is refining my conscience?<br />
She makes all the worldly knots unravel,<br />
Breaking the boundaries put by science,<br />
<br />
With her majestic wings and peculiar smile,<br />
She basked in the sunshine hovering for a while,<br />
As she hovered she dived into a cloud,<br />
And out came a thunderous storm,<br />
<br />
The storm rained black and blue,<br />
Its rain cleansed my sins and woe,<br />
It restored my world to the way it was,<br />
Free from all forms of worry and foe,<br />
<br />
Unaware to all the phoenix had fears,<br />
That nobody shall see her tears,<br />
Tears that flow on seeing people hurt,<br />
She wanted to cleanse the people of dirt,<br />
<br />
The storm that brewed was not of the clouds,<br />
But the rage and pain that brewed in her soul,<br />
With her charm she fooled us with the clouds,<br />
And her tears were the rain that fell to heal,<br />
<br />
The sun rises and sets every day,<br />
But it was dark even today,<br />
The dance she offered today,<br />
Was something to be hailed every day!<br />
<br />
Out came a gust that swept the world,<br />
That filled our hearts with bliss,<br />
It was the songs of the lovely damsel,<br />
That echoed all around the world,<br />
<br />
Her voice echoed into everyone's heart,<br />
Reaching the unreached and heard by all,<br />
It travelled even the deepest of voids,<br />
The cruellest of hearts and through strongest of barriers,<br />
<br />
We all have rules and principles,<br />
Even a religion to show our face,<br />
Simple or profound all have one,<br />
All designed to keep us safe,<br />
<br />
But when she danced, there was a tremor,<br />
An unnatural sense that words failed to name,<br />
It was the waves of shock and surprise,<br />
That my whole life longed to see,<br />
<br />
I felt the rules getting broken,<br />
I sensed my freedom multiply,<br />
It gave me the courage to dare,<br />
The power to question my faith,<br />
<br />
My inhibition tend to fade,<br />
My heart filled with hope,<br />
I dared to take a leap,<br />
That I feared all my life,<br />
<br />
I broke the false shackles of society,<br />
Realised the bounds that surround me,<br />
From a frog confined to a well,<br />
I became a phoenix, wild and unbounded,<br />
<br />
That dance struck my heart with a cure,<br />
And guided me to greater heights and more,<br />
That dance was not a dance, but a fight,<br />
A fight for the meaning of existence,<br />
<br />
Nor was I the only mortal to feel,<br />
But there were many who went with the wind,<br />
All felt a similar remorse at heart,<br />
And did the impossible defined by immortals,<br />
<br />
But that was not the end to the dance,<br />
The dance was rather a choice and chance,<br />
All of a sudden, when all were there to stare,<br />
The damsel stopped and vanished in thin air,<br />
<br />
The lovely phoenix that filled the sky with delight,<br />
Blew into flames and went out of sight,<br />
Filled the sky with a spectacular light and flare,<br />
Sweeping darkness like a second sun in sky,<br />
<br />
Out came the feathers all lit with flames,<br />
Turned into ashes as they touched the grounds,<br />
Ashes untouched filled the lands with meadows,<br />
And among the blades of grass stood a baby bird,<br />
<br />
Among the fortunate who took the ashes,<br />
Their hearts were filled with fire,<br />
A fire that taught passion and compassion,<br />
A fire for meaning, a fire for existence,<br />
<br />
For the sceptical mortals who chose to avoid,<br />
Life was still colourless and void,<br />
For the strugglers and believers who chose to see,<br />
Life went always flamboyant and sane,<br />
<br />
The strugglers and believers who realised the dance,<br />
Who knew it was a choice and chance,<br />
Stood like a lighthouse strong against the waves,<br />
And guided many ships amidst turbulent oceans,<br />
<br />
When coerced, forced, humiliated or betrayed,<br />
Even when the entire world stood against my will,<br />
I stood strong like a king and fought, when,<br />
The damsel appeared and saved my skull,<br />
<br />
Whenever in solitude, alone or in grief,<br />
I remember the dance that lovely damsel gave,<br />
It filled my heart with ecstasy and belief,<br />
That happily haunted me till my grave,<br />
<br />
The dance of the damsel was a message to all,<br />
What everyone can do! In the form of a phoenix!<br />
Those who seek true glory do in front of all,<br />
The Flamboyant Dance of the Phoenix!</div>
<h1 id="fluidic-colours">Fluidic Colours</h1>
<div class="line-block">When the cool winds caressed,<br />
When the waning moon blessed,<br />
The heart was full of colour,<br />
What it meant I wonder.<br />
<br />
The colours came and went,<br />
What emotions they sent?<br />
For every thought a colour emerged,<br />
Thinking about you my thoughts converged.<br />
<br />
Like the flowers that blossomed,<br />
Spreading all the fragrance around,<br />
My love for you blossomed,<br />
Gradually and without any bound.<br />
<br />
Do we have a bond?<br />
Then why do I hear your heart?<br />
As if binded by a wand,<br />
I remember your words by heart.<br />
<br />
Like the birds that sing sweet,<br />
As sweet as honey a lovely treat,<br />
I have a song for you quite upbeat,<br />
True and sincere and hard to retreat.<br />
<br />
Sweet as a nectar my heart feels joy,<br />
On hearing your words, rejoiced this boy,<br />
Our talks and words made no sense,<br />
Yet we can't stop hearing this sweet nonsense.<br />
<br />
Like the leaf on a flowing stream,<br />
The world is changing its scheme,<br />
Amidst many aspirations and dreams,<br />
Time is fleeting and changing its theme.<br />
<br />
What time holds in our future?<br />
Regardless I shall always nurture,<br />
The memories and moments with you persistent,<br />
Change is not my only constant.<br />
<br />
Like the morning dew that rejuvenates,<br />
Thinking of your love my heart scintillates,<br />
In a mystical trance it eternally oscillates,<br />
Meanings of life it quietly resonates.<br />
<br />
All the sparrows and their flock,<br />
Will come together and sing our song.<br />
All the parrots and their flock,<br />
Will come together and write our story long.<br />
<br />
I thank the universe to let our lives cross,<br />
Knitting our lives with moments like a floss,<br />
I don't believe in any god or any faith,<br />
But for you I am ready to leap with faith.<br />
<br />
Traversing life riddle after riddle,<br />
I don't know how it will unfold,<br />
With you beside me it will be gentle,<br />
Together we shall pen a story never told.</div>
<h1 id="gamble-of-waiting">Gamble of Waiting</h1>
<div class="line-block">It is in nature, to expect something,<br />
Very few venture, to gain nothing.<br />
Some events in life, are not so straight,<br />
You might have to, sit and wait.<br />
<br />
Fortune favours the bold some say,<br />
Ask and wait it'll come some say.<br />
Stuck between, is the confused soul,<br />
Lost and clueless, aiming for the goal.<br />
<br />
There is truth in both the cases,<br />
They do work out in many places.<br />
The struggle is real to find the best fit,<br />
When to move forward, and when to just sit.<br />
<br />
Going with the flow, without any care,<br />
Many things will happen, and it may not be fair.<br />
Making up your mind, and seeking what you want,<br />
There is some hope, that you'll get what you want.<br />
<br />
Unfortunate are those, who tried so hard,<br />
Failed many times, tired and charred.<br />
Although not a victor, they did try it out,<br />
They have a closure, and their hearts don't shout.<br />
<br />
Miserable are those, who waited so long,<br />
And hoped that some day, they'll sing a song.<br />
They realised too late, the ships started sailing,<br />
That is a big regret, the gamble of waiting.</div>
<h1 id="game-planner">Game Planner</h1>
<div class="line-block">There is never, a clutter on his table,<br />
Quite a clarity, on what is doable.<br />
Smart and clear, on what he wants to do,<br />
Plans them well, and sticks to it like glue.<br />
<br />
If there are risks that needs to be addressed,<br />
He'll work out smart, without getting digressed.<br />
Quite modest and frank, about who he is,<br />
Reliable and dependable, that's who he is.<br />
<br />
Although he is occupied, with so many plans,<br />
But has the balance, to remember his clans.<br />
Calm and composed, and can be a bit naughty,<br />
Once he makes his mind, he is very doughty.<br />
<br />
A good friend he is, stood for me like a rock,<br />
Whenever there was trouble, he was there to talk.<br />
You are blessed to have, him as a best friend,<br />
His friendship is special, to be cherished till the end.<br />
<br />
As he steps forward, for the next year in his life,<br />
I wish him all the best, for opportunities quite rife.<br />
As he steps forward, for another trip around the sun,<br />
I wish him all the best, for many laurels to be won.<br />
<br />
Being a quirky friend, figuring out his own way,<br />
I cannot thank him enough, for what he had to say.<br />
Many times I feel, I actually won a prize,<br />
For him in my life, is a blessing in disguise.</div>
<h1 id="grace-in-defeat">Grace in Defeat</h1>
<div class="line-block">You hoped it gets lighter,<br />
But it always became tighter,<br />
The moment you win,<br />
The bar is raised, higher and higher.<br />
<br />
With few to tell what went wrong,<br />
You pull yourself out of the abyss,<br />
Still shaken from the fall before,<br />
Trembling and rattling, you keep walking.<br />
<br />
The shattered heart feels the worst,<br />
To stay confident amidst turbulent times,<br />
To be mad amidst the epiphany of a realist,<br />
To choose the road less travelled.<br />
<br />
The victor gets many laurels,<br />
But there is a Grace in Defeat.<br />
It's easy to smile when you win,<br />
Can you do that in your defeat?<br />
<br />
Your heart yearns rest, but the show will go on,<br />
And hence you persist picking your battles wise.<br />
Growing wise and humble, with every defeat,<br />
Less scared and less broken in spirit.<br />
<br />
Oh dear universe, give me the strength!<br />
To let go of the battles I can't win with grace,<br />
To keep the embers burning, in the ones that matter,<br />
And to be wise to know the difference.</div>
<h1 id="imperfectly-perfect">Imperfectly Perfect</h1>
<div class="line-block">You take great care,<br />
And factor every detail,<br />
To do it perfectly,<br />
And everyone applauds you.<br />
<br />
But you are human,<br />
Bound to make errors.<br />
And when you slip,<br />
Others can't accept it.<br />
<br />
When you're aiming perfection,<br />
You go great lengths,<br />
You take great pains,<br />
To make moments right.<br />
<br />
What is the price?<br />
Your pay in return,<br />
Only you know it,<br />
Others can't see it.<br />
<br />
You push the bar,<br />
To a new summit,<br />
Unknowingly you keep adding,<br />
More pressure to yourself.<br />
<br />
The journey of perfection,<br />
Often blinds your vision,<br />
To the self-inflicted harm,<br />
And the agonising loneliness.<br />
<br />
It makes you mad,<br />
To see flawed people,<br />
Doing work just fine,<br />
Cheerful, laughing and happy.<br />
<br />
While you plough through,<br />
So many intricate issues,<br />
That others couldn't see,<br />
And you take responsibility.<br />
<br />
Remind your gentle heart,<br />
That there's nothing wrong,<br />
For the losses incurred,<br />
Were aims too high.<br />
<br />
The peril of perfection,<br />
Constricts your breath away.<br />
Makes you be hard,<br />
On yourself all time.<br />
<br />
While it is good,<br />
To be hard once,<br />
But when done often,<br />
You shatter your peace.<br />
<br />
It throws you ultimatums,<br />
And makes you paralysed,<br />
While trying to make,<br />
Decisions all the time.<br />
<br />
Can you pen tales,<br />
With dry empty pens?<br />
With worn out nibs,<br />
And leaking body parts?<br />
<br />
You my dear perfectionist,<br />
The price you pay,<br />
For being very hard,<br />
Is to break yourself.<br />
<br />
Like the broken pen,<br />
That leaks all ink,<br />
Your sad broken heart,<br />
Leaks all the happiness.<br />
<br />
And just like how,<br />
You seal the cracks,<br />
To stop the leaking,<br />
Your heart needs fixing.<br />
<br />
When a pen breaks,<br />
You can buy another.<br />
When your heart breaks,<br />
Can you replace it?<br />
<br />
The journey of perfection,<br />
Does shackle your limbs,<br />
To break all shackles,<br />
Start loving yourself more.<br />
<br />
You are not satisfied,<br />
Not because of arrogance,<br />
It's that you developed,<br />
A knack for things.<br />
<br />
True perfection occurs when,<br />
Not when under control.<br />
Rather you let go,<br />
Of worries and play.<br />
<br />
While perfection is noble,<br />
And everyone appreciates it,<br />
Others become detached to<br />
What you truly are.<br />
<br />
To strike a bond,<br />
With the people close,<br />
Perfection does not matter,<br />
It is the flaws.<br />
<br />
Despite what you do,<br />
You are a human,<br />
Bound to make errors,<br />
Bound to learn again.<br />
<br />
While it is wise,<br />
To have watchful eyes,<br />
You should understand dear,<br />
It is quite natural.<br />
<br />
This is a lesson,<br />
To keep in mind,<br />
When you plough through,<br />
And hurt yourself badly.<br />
<br />
This is a lesson,<br />
To forget in mind,<br />
When you make mistakes,<br />
And you don't learn.<br />
<br />
When you love yourself,<br />
You accept yourself whole,<br />
The good parts and,<br />
The broken parts too.<br />
<br />
A sense of peace,<br />
Does linger in you,<br />
When you accept yourself,<br />
And it radiates outward.<br />
<br />
You now truly become,<br />
The pen you dreamt,<br />
To write many tales,<br />
To your heart's content.<br />
<br />
This is what truly,<br />
Means to be yourself,<br />
Your heart and mind,<br />
And body in unison.<br />
<br />
When this does happen,<br />
Your heart is full,<br />
Of happiness and joy,<br />
And a serene calmness.<br />
<br />
In such restful state,<br />
The heart is content,<br />
The mind is clear,<br />
Your body is ready.<br />
<br />
Now you set forth,<br />
Your journey of perfection,<br />
You will sail smooth,<br />
And you will win.<br />
<br />
In such restful state,<br />
Your union is complete,<br />
And you find ways,<br />
To correct all flaws.<br />
<br />
Now people will not,<br />
Think of you odd,<br />
For they have seen,<br />
Your best and worst.<br />
<br />
And now more importantly,<br />
They saw your flaws,<br />
And were able to,<br />
Relate with you truly.<br />
<br />
Added to your admiration,<br />
They shall feel related,<br />
The formal talks dissolve,<br />
And the controls fade.<br />
<br />
They now feel calm,<br />
To open themselves up,<br />
For they see you,<br />
As a human too.<br />
<br />
None of us are,<br />
Truly Gods in life.<br />
We may climb up,<br />
But still are humans.<br />
<br />
If we are perfect,<br />
Will we be humans?<br />
That begs the answer,<br />
Imperfections make us human.</div>

Peeping out further,<br />
I gathered all my hope,<br />
To take a lope.<br />
<br />
I stand at the edge,<br />
Thinking of a pledge,<br />
To walk on the road,<br />
And make stories untold.<br />
<br />
I once locked my heart,<br />
Suppressed all my art,<br />
My heart felt a void,<br />
And I never enjoyed.<br />

I am ready to leap,<br />
To explore deep,<br />
I won't be a shadow,<br />
I'll bask in the meadow.<br />

I see an open road,<br />
I dropped my past load,<br />
I leapt into a spree,<br />
The journey set me free.</div>

Residing in your heart, a fire so bright,<br />
Brighter than the stars, I can see combined,<br />
A will so strong, forged from sun's core.<br />
You are a Queen, with the nerves of Steel.</div>
<h1 id="it-is-never-easy">It is never easy</h1>
<div class="line-block">It is quite a test, that pushes all your buttons,<br />
Whenever he or she, asks those questions,<br />
In their own odd ways, they do quite care,<br />
But in the process, they break and make you.<br />
<br />
It is quite easy, to take them as your enemy,<br />
They do disagree, to a lot you say,<br />
Most of us are, quite fortunate that,<br />
They are not indeed your enemies.<br />
<br />
They did give birth, to you in this world,<br />
And for a long time, you didn't know any better,<br />
So they took it upon, themselves to raise you,<br />
And it is quite hard, for them to step back.<br />
<br />
And when you start to grow, the struggles begin.<br />
And within a matter of time, you fight against them.<br />
You have the youth, and resilience to spring back,<br />
They have their wisdom and worldly caution.<br />
<br />
With time, in this changing world,<br />
The struggle is real, to put forth your points.<br />
Amidst many arguments, and many expectations,<br />
In the heated debates, the egos clash.<br />
<br />
It is quite an irony, in the journey of life,<br />
How often the people you love tend to hurt you.<br />
But despite the fights, most of us are lucky,<br />
As they are the ones, who love you the most.<br />
<br />
Raising kids was never an easy task,<br />
With changing times, there were no rules,<br />
As you grow up, you thought they knew it all,<br />
As you mature, you see the plight they faced.<br />
<br />
While they do care, they have their demons,<br />
Demons of expectations, fears and insecurities,<br />
Some made sense and some will not,<br />
Despite the obscurity, they love you truly.<br />
<br />
As you grow old, you start to empathise,<br />
And try to reconcile, the differences you have,<br />
You take a deep breath, and let go the anger,<br />
In the moments of silence, you step in their shoes.<br />
<br />
You realise that it's long and hard learning,<br />
You learnt a lot, and still, have a lot to learn.<br />
You tread carefully, and sensibly as possible,<br />
And in those moments, you feel their burden.<br />
<br />
You and them might be poles apart,<br />
Both you and they care deeply for the other,<br />
It is, however, the flaws in us and the words,<br />
That pushes and pulls both you and them.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you wonder, can't it be easy?<br />
It is in some cases; it isn't in some cases,<br />
There is no winner in these fights all the time,<br />
As long as no one is left helpless and alone.</div>
<h1 id="keep-smiling">Keep Smiling</h1>
<div class="line-block">When life hits you hard,<br />
Breaks your heart into shards,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
When things are hopeless<br />
And you are clueless,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
When the odds do not favour,<br />
You persist with fervour,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
When you have the courage,<br />
To rise against the discourage,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
You know you're vincible,<br />
But giving up is impossible,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
You fear because you're wise,<br />
You hide it in disguise,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
When you're truly scared,<br />
But persist facing the feared,<br />
At that moment,<br />
Keep Smiling.<br />
<br />
The smile you put shall hide,<br />
All the pain on the inside,<br />
But it is needed to move onward,<br />
The needed courage to go forward.<br />
<br />
Though the smile is fake,<br />
It keeps the hope awake.<br />
It's easy to smile when nothing is at a loss,<br />
Can you smile when everything is at a loss?<br />
<br />
I can smile despite having nothing,<br />
I learnt to smile losing everything.<br />
That surprises people,<br />
And it amazes me too.</div>
<h1 id="let-it-go">Let it go</h1>
<div class="line-block">When the dreamer in you, tells you to go,<br />
While the realist in you, tells you to let go,<br />
The conflict will be an intense tug of war,<br />
The torn heart with scars the spoils-of-war.<br />
<br />
There is admiration in trying, and being persistent,<br />
Wiping all your sweat, and trying to be consistent.<br />
How long can you, put up such resistance?<br />
When the other side offers, very little insistence?<br />
<br />
Somethings in life, though you made no fault,<br />
You can't do much, and you fail by default.<br />
The dreamer in you, hoped something different,<br />
Even the realist in you, was ready to be belligerent.<br />
<br />
Amidst the darkness, cries the heart in loneliness,<br />
It was hopeful and eager, among life's wilderness.<br />
There is nothing wrong, if you can't carry on,<br />
You've tried your best, it's time to move on.<br />
<br />
When you started the journey, there was no map,<br />
It was unfortunate, that life gave you a tight slap.<br />
How long can you walk, carrying all the past?<br />
Burdening your injured heart, healing under a cast?<br />
<br />
You are brave and strong, to hold on very long,<br />
It is time to let go, and there is nothing wrong.<br />
It does not mean, you don't care anymore,<br />
It means you choose, to love yourself more.</div>
<h1 id="love-under-the-stars">Love under the Stars</h1>
<div class="line-block">Holding your hands, we walked the coast,<br />
In the candle light dinner, we had a toast.<br />
From twilight to midnight, the moments were right,<br />
You're in my sight, beautiful and bright!<br />
<br />
Meeting your eyes, and seeing the twinkle,<br />
I shower my love, like a garden sprinkle.<br />
Holding you up close, like a gentle rose,<br />
You're the woman I chose, a wonderful prose.<br />
<br />
Just like last night, before the midnight,<br />
Let's make it right, and travel out of sight!<br />
No one to find us, and the stars to guide us,<br />
Just the two of us, and no worldly fuss.<br />
<br />
In the middle of nowhere, in a moment so rare,<br />
With consent I dare, and kiss you with care.<br />
With a sensual caress, let us undress,<br />
With much love to express, let's not digress.<br />
<br />
The night was calm, and you were warm,<br />
With our eyes to conform, we rhymed uniform.<br />
Amidst the sandy dust, we quench our lust,<br />
With nothing to adjust, hearts full of trust.<br />
<br />
I want to get lost, like a tiny little frost,<br />
I want you to get lost, like a tiny little frost.<br />
And find eachother, inside eachother,<br />
We'll be together, and this bond is forever.</div>
<h1 id="magi">Magi</h1>
<div class="line-block">Someone knocked my door,<br />
And brought me back to the world.<br />
What is it you seek? I asked.<br />
None, What do you seek? They asked back.<br />
<br />
Why did you come? I never called them.<br />
Your heart was in agony, they told me.<br />
Baffled and confused, I let them in,<br />
They brought gifts, queer and rare.<br />
<br />
I seek many and I felt lost, I told,<br />
Seek what is certain, you will be fine, they told.<br />
I try hard, and yet I don't grow, I told.<br />
Do you rest inbetween and heal? They asked.<br />
<br />
Whatever I learn, it is incomplete I told.<br />
Be an open bowl, and remove the lens, they told.<br />
I keep trying, and somethings never happen, I told.<br />
Keep trying and grow, things will happen, they told.<br />
<br />
No one understands me, I try to, I told.<br />
Know yourself, and others will follow, they told.<br />
I aim too high, and fall too low, I told.<br />
You are mature but naive, go steady they told.<br />
<br />
I feel I am inadequate, and I am hard, I told.<br />
Realise you can find what you want, they told.<br />
Will I be happy? Will this happiness last? I asked.<br />
It will last, they told, as long as your heart is free.</div>
<h1 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h1>
<div class="line-block">When you feel low, and time flows slow,<br />
The world moves fast, and you feel you're last,<br />
Trying to evade the pain, you wander in vain,<br />
Buried in your thought, you feel lost.<br />
<br />
You hear voices, deciding your choices,<br />
Hold on to your braces; these are just noises.<br />
When your fear summons, the inner demons,<br />
It is okay to yelp we are there to help.<br />
<br />
The mind is very fickle, and problems do trickle,<br />
Better act quick, before you get sick,<br />
Mental illness is not subtle, and needs no rebuttal,<br />
What can you truly gain, by suppressing all the pain?<br />
<br />
Such illness is uncommon, but naysayers are common,<br />
But don't let the outrage, drain down your courage.<br />
You are not insane, and those who say so are a bane!<br />
Tend to your brain that is in pain!</div>
<h1 id="midnight-dreams">Midnight Dreams</h1>
<div class="line-block">I am thankful,<br />
for that glance from your eyes,<br />
I am blessed,<br />
for our intertwined fingers,<br />
I pray,<br />
for this night to never end,<br />
I hear your heart,<br />
whenever our eyes meet,<br />
<br />
In this blissful solitude,<br />
your presence fills my soul,<br />
I am in your arms; you are in mine,<br />
naked and shameless, in our little world,<br />
I am grateful,<br />
for the universe to unite us,<br />
I hope this is forever,<br />
the bond we have for each other.</div>
<h1 id="moonlight">Moonlight</h1>
<div class="line-block">One day, I looked at the mirror,<br />
Then found, a hair quite silver,<br />
Seems yesterday, I started my journey,<br />
Years passed, and I gathered memories.<br />
<br />
Behind me, I see many laurels,<br />
Many goals, that I won trying,<br />
Many defeats, that I lost trying,<br />
Many lessons, that tempered me well.<br />
<br />
I'm surprised, for the paths crossed,<br />
Never imagined, the place I'm now,<br />
Did quit, on some ventures before,<br />
Yet persisting, on many ventures still.<br />
<br />
I walked, past the cold streets,<br />
The darkness, that tried luring me,<br />
The burdens, that made me question,<br />
The doubts, that pulled me back.<br />
<br />
I still, have doubts and burdens,<br />
But then, the fog is clearing,<br />
Through it, I see light streaks,<br />
The darkness, is now slowly receding.<br />
<br />
I struggled, to find myself clear,<br />
My heart, did break into pieces,<br />
That's when, it fully opened up,<br />
And I, found myself quite clear.<br />
<br />
I was, once full of doubts,<br />
I still, have a long road,<br />
But slowly, I am finding strength,<br />
And surprised, to tackle it well.<br />
<br />
The fog, that clouded my judgement,<br />
Became thin, and started to fade,<br />
Through it, I see light streaks,<br />
Out came, the moon to guide.<br />
<br />
With time, it gave me peace,<br />
Quite detached, from what is around,<br />
Yet attached, to what I want,<br />
Still cheerful, but calm and composed.<br />
<br />
Then I, realised in a moment,<br />
The moon, that shined all night,<br />
Did vanish, yet there was light,<br />
I realised, the moonlight in me.<br />
<br />
Don't lose, the hope in yourself,<br />
This pain, shall also pass soon,<br />
You strain, and break your muscles,<br />
You rise, with more stronger muscles.<br />
<br />
You grow, at your own pace,<br />
You break, your heart many times,<br />
But still, mend your broken pieces,<br />
What is, a moon without craters?</div>
<h1 id="more-than-what-meets-the-eye">More than what meets the Eye</h1>
<div class="line-block">I saw you that day by mere chance,<br />
And I chose to give you a glance.<br />
What can happen between us?<br />
We are mere passengers in this life bus.<br />
<br />
You are a whole universe all by yourself,<br />
A unique book from a library bookshelf.<br />
Trying to know you by reading every page,<br />
You are one enigma bound to no cage.<br />
<br />
At the onset of our journey I was quite scared,<br />
Seeing your wounds I realised you're scarred!<br />
Life was never easy and rosy as they say,<br />
It is hard for all to keep our problems at bay.<br />
<br />
It is a risk and quite a gamble,<br />
To approach you looking at your preamble.<br />
Will I see meadows, rivers, and fruit trees?<br />
Or a barren desert, with scorching land breeze?<br />
<br />
I only see glimpses of what you are,<br />
To know you more I need to travel so far!<br />
There is an urge in me to not to say goodbye,<br />
You are more than what meets the eye!<br />
<br />
It takes patience and faith to take the call,<br />
To try and know you and risk losing it all.<br />
I undress my soul with all my guards down,<br />
I show myself true don't shoot me down!</div>
<h1 id="my-time-has-come">My time has come</h1>
<div class="line-block">The bow is stretched to the yielding limit,<br />
The axe is now very sharp,<br />
The wasted carbon was buried deep,<br />
All waiting for the grand fine judgement.<br />
<br />
The foes are clear and their strategies are out,<br />
The wait is over and my time has come,<br />
All the joharis are now very clear,<br />
The last few straws are now no more,<br />
<br />
Seneca's words came true now,<br />
And all the fake masks are now torn,<br />
My rules and religions are now strong,<br />
Now they shall keep me safe,<br />
<br />
I was burried with a huge burden,<br />
Which gave me strength to bear the pain,<br />
I was innocent to be played with deceit,<br />
Which helped me learn to tear your mask,<br />
<br />
I wanted help when I suffered a crisis,<br />
But I received subterfuges in return,<br />
In the middle of all this rat race and poignance,<br />
I regained parts of my west windy childhood,<br />
<br />
The rules you have now,<br />
Will slowly be shattered,<br />
In the middle of the turbulence,<br />
You will question back your faith.<br />
<br />
The arrow ready to fire,<br />
The axe is ready to cut,<br />
The carbon is now a diamond,<br />
Now I shall write your fate!<br />
<br />
Can faint clouds block the sun?<br />
Can hurricanes be blocked by trees?<br />
Can hyenas delight with all the fun<br />
When a furious lion hunts them?</div>
<h1 id="nameday">Nameday</h1>
<div class="line-block">The beautiful moon in the sky,<br />
All of a sudden became shy,<br />
Watching it, I wondered why,<br />
<br />
Wandering the sky all around,<br />
It stood still to hear the sound,<br />
Of a song so profound,<br />
<br />
Lines that rhyme sweet and fine,<br />
With grace and elegance so divine,<br />
Sang the boy of age twenty-five.<br />
<br />
The twinkling stars made the ambience bliss,<br />
The beauty of his song quite hard to miss,<br />
The lively voice was such a bliss,<br />
<br />
The clouds gathered to see him sing,<br />
As happy subjects meeting a king,<br />
With a truant thunder giving a timely ring,<br />
<br />
The rain showered, like the tears of joy,<br />
To praise the talent of this beautiful boy,<br />
Me the witness could only enjoy,<br />
<br />
The stars twinkled and wished him hope,<br />
Blessing him, a life with a rising slope,<br />
And strength to pass barriers with a lope,<br />
<br />
The shy moon beamed a bright glow,<br />
And danced in ecstasy, a beautiful show,<br />
I wished the time would move slow,<br />
<br />
Many more happy returns of the day,<br />
A life full with sun’s ray,<br />
Beyond that, what can I say?</div>
<h1 id="nemesis-reborn">Nemesis Reborn</h1>
<div class="line-block">You thought you won when you broke me that day,<br />
That dance of arrogance, I still remember,<br />
My heart did swell, and bled with a vengeance,<br />
Anger did boil, and flowed through my veins,<br />
<br />
While you danced and rejoiced, I stood up once more,<br />
With hands of diamonds, and nerves of steel,<br />
Gone are the days, I played for sport,<br />
Now I am ruthless, with a spine-chilling smile,<br />
<br />
When we meet to fight, you will tremble in fear,<br />
All the sins of your life will flash in front of your eyes,<br />
Flee if you want, it won't matter,<br />
For I will find you, and I will kill you,<br />
<br />
Say your prayers, and count your blessings,<br />
For the monster you are, you deserve no pity,<br />
You saw me fall, now see me rise,<br />
Run far away; your nemesis is reborn.</div>

My ship is waiting,<br />
My time is fleeting,<br />

But my journey beckons,<br />
And I must go on,<br />
<br />
A nomad I came,<br />
With no strings attached,<br />
Then why is it hard,<br />
To leave detached,<br />
<br />
I am going high,<br />
My heart racing fast,<br />
For fear of falling,<br />
For fear of leaving,<br />
<br />
The nights of solitude,<br />
The jokes and sadness,<br />
The days of sunshine,<br />
And countless desires,<br />

I came here once,<br />
To leave a mark,<br />
But now I feel,<br />
The place marked me,<br />

I want to say,<br />
That I love you,<br />
A million miles away,<br />

Feeling neither guilt or shame,<br />
For him both are the same.<br />

Who is he knows no one,<br />
But looks normal like anyone.<br />
Works alone without someone,<br />
He moves on waiting for none.<br />

Made mistakes quite a tonne.<br />
Accepting the past with regrets none,<br />

A letter of love, with lyrics of divine,<br />

Longing for your glance, in the waves of life,<br />
Will you be my star and guide me to haven?<br />

The shades of violet, the limitless sea,<br />
The endless sky, the sparkle of sapphire,<br />
The face of Neptune, the adorable Smurfs,<br />
Nothing matches the blue of your eyes,<br />

The emptiness of space, the kajal of your eyes,<br />
The feathers of a raven, the darkest of nights,<br />
The night tulips, the sharpest obsidian,<br />
Nothing matches the black of your hair,<br />

The flawless cumulus, the ravishing jasmine,<br />
The foam on the waves, the teeth of a baby,<br />
The purest of milk, the flags of peace,<br />
Nothing matches the white of your heart,<br />

My Geetanjali of music, My Ponanjali of dreams,<br />

In the evening twilight, I saw a sun rising,<br />
I turned to see it, and I saw you,<br />
In the weariness of the evening, I had a dream,<br />
It was about you, and you came in front of me,<br />

I want to hold your hand, and walk on the beach,<br />
See the beautiful sunset, as you lean on me,<br />
The winds caress my hair, and kissed my cheek,<br />
I turned to see you, and our eyes met,<br />

As we talked and chatted, the birds did chirp,<br />
It told me to come near, and told me to hold you,<br />
We didn't speak a word, but our hearts talked a lot,<br />
With a bit of mischief, we ran to paint the town red.</div>

Let people touch your string that connect,<br />
Each and every one and form a theory.<br />

When times are dark and hopes are faint,<br />
When good is rare and faith is shaking,<br />
Give people strength to sail the storms,<br />
Give them courage to remain strong.<br />

Let poverty vanish from the world,<br />
Let the hungry children get a good meal,<br />

Let all the suffering, corruption, and all things bad,<br />
Let all of these feel that they have no bond with this world.<br />

Let each family have a heaven within,<br />
Let there be events to rejuvenate the happiness,<br />
Does a butterfly need a license to fly?<br />
Let the same be for the living and love.<br />

Let it happen in its own pace,<br />

Throw out signs and please let us know,<br />
Lend us the magic to set things right,<br />
And bless us with your immaculate grace,<br />

Shower your rays of joy to all living souls,<br />
Help them realise their roles in this cosmic existence,<br />

&quot;World is an involution! With no cure to advice!&quot;<br />

<div class="line-block">I look up in the sky,<br />
To see you fly by,<br />
You spread your wings wide,<br />
Majestic as a king by my side.<br />
<br />
With eyes very sharp,<br />
You dive near a scarp,<br />
Catching prey at sight,<br />
With a strong might.<br />
<br />
Basking in the sky all day,<br />
I have no words to say,<br />
All the awe and wonder I see,<br />
I am jumping like a kid with glee.<br />
<br />
Little does anyone know,<br />
What it took to bestow,<br />
Such wonder is your gift!<br />
And speed so vibrant and swift.<br />
<br />
Share your vision with me,<br />
And grant your focus to me,<br />
So I may never lose track,<br />
When I need to go off track.<br />
<br />
Share your grace with me,<br />
And grant your demeanour to me,<br />
So I may handle my rise with grace,<br />
And be calm during disgrace.<br />
<br />
Share your strength with me,<br />
And grant your wings to me,<br />
So I may stay strong and fly,<br />
And never quit to try.<br />
<br />
Share your hope with me,<br />
And grant your courage to me,<br />
So I may pass through troubles rife,<br />
And fly above the storm of life.</div>

<div class="line-block">Blood or by bond, now we're kith and kin,<br />
Even with different feathers, we flocked together,<br />
Met by chance, united by destiny,<br />
Our hearts beat in sync, even when we're far.<br />
<br />
In your presence, everything feels fine,<br />
In your absence, everything feels amiss,<br />
You pull me to light when I am in the dark<br />
You showed me hope, in this cruel world.<br />
<br />
My confidant, my traitor, my fan, my critic,<br />
My trustee, my liability, my light, my darkness,<br />
My friend, my foe, my companion, my rival,<br />
My angel, my devil, my blessing, my curse.<br />
<br />
I'll pull you down when you act all mighty,<br />
And push you up, when you feel all lost,<br />
I tease you a lot; I might make you sad,<br />
But I genuinely care, in crisis, I'll be there!</div>
<h1 id="reconcile">Reconcile</h1>
<div class="line-block">Between right and wrong, being stuck so long,<br />
When two poles meet, with no room for defeat,<br />
Amidst truth and lies, hiding in disguise,<br />
There is some wisdom, without conundrum.<br />
<br />
The angel is in peace, with divine expertise,<br />
The devil is content, with ignorant intent,<br />
Fighting all desire, like ice and fire,<br />
Lost is the mortal, trying to be an immortal.<br />
<br />
Two roads once met, and regret filled me,<br />
I chose the road levelled, for the road less travelled,<br />
And I made my peace, healthy and in one piece,<br />
Problems never cease, but I decided to find peace.<br />
<br />
When you travel a while, it is hard to reconcile,<br />
Life is not stark, like light and dark.<br />
It is natural to stray; we are genuinely grey.<br />
Make peace with the wrong; life is not that long.</div>
<h1 id="recursive-clock">Recursive Clock</h1>
<div class="line-block">The moment I got you, I never went back,<br />
Turning your dials, time became simple.<br />
As your hands moved, she began to sway,<br />
The unseen enchantress became my lover forever.<br />
<br />
Is this magic? Or is this a wonder?<br />
I visited my past self, ahead in the future.<br />
Saved my younger self, from taking a wrong turn,<br />
I lived a hundred years, in a fraction of a second.<br />
<br />
Am I blessed to have you? Or cursed to possess you?<br />
The power you hold is quite unfathomable.<br />
For once in my life, I feel like God!<br />
I can undo my wrongs, and rewrite the world!<br />
<br />
Time became my lover, and I became a nomad!<br />
Travelling to and fro, between the past and future.<br />
I dropped the infamous apple that made Newton blink!<br />
Gave the thought to Einstein, and made the world think!</div>
<h1 id="respect-is-not-love">Respect is not Love</h1>
<div class="line-block">It is in humans, to talk about valour,<br />
About seeking glory, and finding honour.<br />
When you reach a summit, others shall admire,<br />
For you reached a goal, others will desire.<br />
<br />
Those who seek you then, may not fan your flame,<br />
Drawn to all the name, and the spotlight of fame.<br />
At the end of the day, this is a number's game,<br />
We're enticed to play, although it is quite lame.<br />
<br />
It is quite a paradox, when you see it this way,<br />
With many to admire, yet none to see you that way.<br />
As you shine bright, they see a perfect image,<br />
Unaware of the depth, and many many rummage.<br />
<br />
If you think that is love, then you are quite wrong,<br />
Although they respect you, and even sing a song.<br />
It takes a lot of wisdom, to push your fame aside,<br />
And see you who you are, and love you with pride!<br />
<br />
When you stand and shine, people will respect you,<br />
Ask you for favours, and many offers from you.<br />
While there is respect, this is not love they send,<br />
You are a salvation, a mere means to an end.<br />
<br />
Respect and love, are two different feelings,<br />
Both can co-exist, deep in a heart's dwellings.<br />
Respect can make possible, for true love to flourish,<br />
But respect is not love, that's a message to cherish.</div>

<h1 id="sailing-amidst-shipwrecks">Sailing amidst Shipwrecks</h1>
<div class="line-block">When your naive heart, sees the strong gale,<br />
Decides to take a voyage, and let the ship sail.<br />
But little did the heart see, what lied beyond the coast,<br />
Of the rough tides, and the brewing storms.<br />
<br />
Shipwrecked often, I feel quite lost,<br />
Frozen by the waters, and scorched by the heat.<br />
Holding on to the embers, of hope at any cost,<br />
I silently pray for help, to overcome defeat.<br />
<br />
Finding the inner strength is hard at this moment,<br />
I feel weak and frail, to even face a gentle breeze.<br />
The scars of the past, that kept you grounded,<br />
Now weighs too much, for you to stay afloat.<br />
<br />
As I struggle to float, I'm counting my blessings,<br />
Holding on tight, to the fast receding dreams.<br />
My hands are bloody, and parched as well,<br />
Being pushed to breathe, while underwater.<br />
<br />
Amidst all the turbulence, despite all the pain,<br />
Amidst the icy cold, despite the blistering heat,<br />
I am fighting all I can, with every ounce of strength,<br />
Longing hard for the light, of that one guiding star.<br />
<br />
How long can I keep up, such a fight I don't know,<br />
My naive heart still beats, for the joys of tomorrow.<br />
Sailing amidst shipwrecks, I am mending my heart,<br />
Stitching all the pieces, for a voyage once again.</div>

<div class="line-block">The days grew short,<br />
The winds blew cold.<br />
But that can't twart,<br />
The festival quite old!<br />
<br />
Patience is quite needed,<br />
Now it's top seeded.<br />
For I have to wait,<br />
And not fall to bait.<br />
<br />
I wished for a gift,<br />
Time was slow to drift,<br />
As I waited all alone,<br />
Cold to the bone.<br />
<br />
All of a sudden,<br />
I found a gift hidden,<br />
Better than what I asked,<br />
A book of poems unasked!<br />
<br />
Who are you, Santa?<br />
I'm smiling in joy.<br />
Where are you, Santa?<br />
I'm jumping like a boy!<br />

Thank you quite truly,<br />
For the gift so duly.<br />
Love you with all my heart,<br />

<h1 id="silience">Silience</h1>
<div class="line-block">Now you're famous, and everyone speaks of you,<br />
But when you were new, I never heard about you,<br />
Walking down the streets, I didn't notice you play,<br />
Now I do wonder, how I missed your grace,<br />
<br />
That made me wonder, is brilliance everywhere?<br />
Waiting to be discovered, or failed to get noticed?<br />
As I ponder over, It dawned upon me,<br />
Indifference is easy, but fighting is hard,<br />
<br />
The struggle is severe, to do what you love,<br />
When not a soul to see, the beauty in your work,<br />
Hoping for a break, you valiantly try every day,<br />
One day will come, and your work will be seen,<br />
<br />
Brilliance is around us, waiting to be found,<br />
A moment from our lives is all we need to find,<br />
The next epic artist could live next door,<br />
Burning the midnight oil, perfecting the craft.</div>
<h1 id="solitude">Solitude</h1>

And the pain began easing,<br />

While the world kept running,<br />
Time froze still,<br />
A flurry of emotions came,<br />
And receded like a tide,<br />
<br />
Amidst the emptiness,<br />
My thoughts grew loud,<br />
As I let them go,<br />
I found peace and happiness,<br />
<br />
In the noise of the world,<br />
I love this moment,<br />
A moment of bliss,<br />
Time for solitude.</div>
<h1 id="sonder">Sonder</h1>
<div class="line-block">You and I are quite similar.<br />
In an incident, we crossed paths,<br />
With a billion walking, in this mystical world,<br />
Why did we meet? Is this destiny?<br />
<br />
I am to you, what you are to me,<br />
A stranger in a corner, and drinking tea,<br />
A close friend, or kith and kin,<br />
An acquaintance, or a well-wisher,<br />
<br />
The love of my life, or my greatest foe,<br />
Or a passerby in a train, sitting near a window,<br />
Someone I wished but never realised,<br />
A bad dream or a passing cloud,<br />
<br />
The roles are complex, diverse, and plenty,<br />
It is strange we met, among many,<br />
While my life is full, rich, and unique,<br />
I am to you, what you are to me.</div>
<h1 id="star-child">Star Child</h1>
<div class="line-block">Days will come and days will go,<br />
The trifles of life can weigh you down.<br />
Hope may seem bleak and future uncertain, - yet,<br />
Don't settle for the dust, my star child.<br />
<br />
Your blissful solitude may turn to silence,<br />
Your heart might prefer violence,<br />
Amidst hardship, defeat and despair,<br />
Don't settle for the dust, my star child.<br />
<br />
When the myriad walls that keep you safe break,<br />
Making you question your faith,<br />
Keeping you pondering with sleepless nights,<br />
Don't settle for the dust, my star child.<br />
<br />
At these times, hope may seem faint,<br />
You might feel well-off being a saint,<br />
With trials and tribulations seemingly vain,<br />
Don't settle for the dust, my star child.<br />
<br />
When your lookout for love goes barren,<br />
When drifting friendships make you sad,<br />
When the gravity of reality weighs on you,<br />
Don't settle for the dust, my star child.<br />
<br />
Days will go, but keep fighting,<br />
The war will be won, despite a few battles,<br />
Where is the chase when things go smooth?<br />
Be strong and move on, my star child.<br />
<br />
Search your feelings in the cold silence,<br />
You will know that there is no end to violence,<br />
The harder you burn on the inside,<br />
The brighter you shine to all my star child.<br />
<br />
Walls can crumble, but ideas cannot,<br />
Test your faith; it strengthens your resolve,<br />
Confront the storm with might, my dear,<br />
You will emerge stronger, my star child.<br />
<br />
Flow like a stream my star child,<br />
Forge your way, noble and brave.<br />
All your efforts will come around,<br />
You'll reap bounties far and wide.<br />
<br />
Pursue your passion my star child,<br />
Lose your self and bask in its glory.<br />
Your passion will find your lost self back,<br />
Infinitely strong and wise you'll become,<br />
<br />
You are not alone, my star child,<br />
There are many like you burning inside,<br />
Amidst pain and suffering, they are bright,<br />
A symbol they are, that all things not lost.<br />
<br />
Why do we fall? Tell me my star child,<br />
To master the art of picking ourselves up.<br />
The bigger you fall, the higher you rise,<br />
Keep moving; you are in for a surprise.<br />
<br />
You might seem odd, unflagging all alone,<br />
But your light guides the mortals in their nights.<br />
Lost in the sea navigating on chunks of dust,<br />
Finding their way home, in vast never-ending seas.<br />
<br />
Real friends are like stars, my star child,<br />
Sometimes, they are far far away.<br />
But they are always around you,<br />
Even in your darkest night my dear.<br />
<br />
You are the child of sun my dear one,<br />
Born to accomplish a higher purpose.<br />
The gravity of it is unfathomable,<br />
To other mortals who try to eclipse you.<br />
<br />
Your grandparents the cosmos, are there for you,<br />
Looking after you, through thick and thin.<br />
As we speak, they listen to your prayers,<br />
And conspiring an angel for you.<br />
<br />
You will meet the angel from heaven,<br />
Forged in hellfire, nourished by the elixir.<br />
You will find love and the whole nine yards,<br />
So do not be sad, soon, you'll be glad.<br />
<br />
You are the child of sun my dear one,<br />
After every winter, you'll face a summer,<br />
So don't settle for the dust, my star child,<br />
For you are the substance that makes suns!</div>
<h1 id="storm-breaker">Storm Breaker</h1>
<div class="line-block">Shipwrecked in the past, haunted by memories,<br />
You doubted a lighthouse, which could set you free,<br />
A heart so naive that trusted blind,<br />
Now scarred and broken, scared and hurt,<br />
<br />
A storm brewed within your heart,<br />
Winds of torments, and rains of tears,<br />
Like the waves of a sea, this too shall pass,<br />
The failures of the past, tell you who you are.<br />
<br />
Be strong my dear one, and keep calm,<br />
Open your heart, and let the past go,<br />
Storms will come, and storms will go,<br />
And you'll emerge strong, and wise,<br />
<br />
Face the storm head-on, my child,<br />
You are strong and brave and wild,<br />
When others flee a storm, you break one,<br />
Have faith and sail, my mighty storm breaker.</div>
<h1 id="the-soul-catcher">The Soul Catcher</h1>
<div class="line-block">Many days I walked, alone and restless,<br />
Chasing my dreams, hard and endless,<br />
Ever trying my best, to complete fullness,<br />
Trying to fill a void, a deep emptiness.<br />
<br />
You don't speak a word, you sleep,<br />
Your kind face forever, in my heart I'll keep,<br />
You wipe my tears, whenever I weep,<br />
Let me sing a song, for you to rest deep.<br />
<br />
Like the eyelids to the eye, I will be close to you,<br />
Protecting you from harm, I shall be with you,<br />
Till you break your rest, my eyes won't rest for you,<br />
That is the least I can, always do for you.<br />
<br />
I asked the flowers: Is this a dream?<br />
To have you in my life, in joy I scream!<br />
Adding joy to my life, you are a stream,<br />
Whenever we kiss, you taste like cream.<br />
<br />
I curse the autumn winds that give you the cold,<br />
As you sleep in sickness, ill care for you until I'm old,<br />
I bless the summer winds that made me so bold,<br />
To meet you and tell, what my heart truly told.<br />
<br />
As you lie in my lap, I am reading a book,<br />
A book so dear to you that I'll never overlook.<br />
I wonder and ponder, what did it take,<br />
Your precious little heart, to get such a hook?<br />
<br />
My heart once wandered, hither and thither,<br />
Drifting in the wind, like a lonely feather,<br />
Changing its emotions, just like the weather,<br />
Until you came in and became my tether.<br />
<br />
You don't speak a word, my dear,<br />
I feel your words, loud and clear,<br />
Whatever happens, you don't fear,<br />
I am strong now, and the troubles I can bear,<br />
<br />
As you sleep in peace, I'll touch you gently,<br />
I'll comb your hair to ease, all its knots feebly.<br />
Rest all you want; there is nothing so urgently,<br />
I have to take care of them all, well and attentively.<br />
<br />
Even if you are far, my heart is close to you,<br />
When I hear your voice, my eyes search for you,<br />
In happiness and sadness, my heart is full of you,<br />
I dared to jump the skies, to be with you.<br />
<br />
Once I was a storm chaser, running far and wide,<br />
Till one storm caught me and tossed me aside.<br />
Now I am a Stormbreaker, being a chaser's guide,<br />
My catcher in the rye, my soon to be the bride!<br />
<br />
I ask the spring winds, for many beautiful days,<br />
As we celebrate our wedding, with bliss and gay.<br />
I ask for the winter winds, to keep the stars at bay,<br />
To keep the clouds grey, for us to cuddle that way.</div>
<h1 id="to-try-or-to-wait">To try or to wait</h1>
<div class="line-block">Fortune favours the bold some say,<br />
Good things happen for those who wait some say,<br />
Then why do some who try hard fail?<br />
Then why do some who wait do fail?<br />
<br />
Things in life are complex, and not quite stark,<br />
The difference is not apparent, as light and dark.<br />
There is some truth, in things they both say,<br />
Also lies some lies, in things they both say.<br />
<br />
Even those who wait, never truly waited,<br />
They also tried a bit, and never truly seated.<br />
Even those who tried never kept trying,<br />
They also rested a while; else they were lying.<br />
<br />
Therein lies the answer, to this conundrum,<br />
A delicately crafted balance, devoid of any tantrum.<br />
One should wait when needed, and try when needed,<br />
And the wisdom to see them is quite needed.<br />
<br />
It is not so easy, to wait in some moments,<br />
Nor is it easy, to run and grab the moments.<br />
One must persist, and be ready to recede,<br />
That is one skill, you gain when you concede.<br />
<br />
Praying towards the universe, I ask for serenity,<br />
To sail through crisis and times of uncertainty.<br />
I ask for strength, to try or wait at will,<br />
An abundance of wisdom, to quickly learn this skill.</div>

On this very day, as I wander and ponder,<br />
I seek your blessings, as I turn around again,<br />
<br />
I was born a human, with a spirit of a bird,<br />
I wish to fly high, and touch the milky clouds,<br />
To sail against the wind, amidst turbulent times,<br />
I seek your good wishes, as I turn around again,<br />
<br />
On this day I think, of old times and days,<br />
My throat does stiffen, and a sad smile lingers,<br />
With all these people around, I feel you missing<br />
I seek your divine presence, as I turn around again,<br />
<br />
I must move on; I have promises to keep,<br />
I linger for a moment, to capture your grace,<br />
A new year for me, I want you to be there,<br />
Around the Sun I go, as I turn around again!</div>

Thawed my heart old,<br />
Rusty and cold.<br />
<br />
Finding trust is very rare,<br />
Earlier I didn't care,<br />
I wandered here and there,<br />
I couldn't find it anywhere.<br />
<br />
This breeze I saw,<br />
Made my heart thaw,<br />
I then had a light,<br />
My future was bright.<br />
<br />
I was kind and warm,<br />
Ever happy and calm,<br />
Like a fruit with a worm,<br />
My life had a storm.<br />
<br />
Navigating at all cost,<br />
I found myself lost.<br />
All the aims I dreamed,<br />
Many got shipwrecked.<br />
<br />
I dig my thoughts deep,<br />
On many nights I weep,<br />
In that pain I became cold,<br />
Unrelenting and bold.<br />
<br />
Amidst all deception,<br />
I saw a conclusion.<br />
The ridings were rough,<br />
The tidings were tough.<br />
<br />
Without any digress,<br />
I worked for progress,<br />
My life turned around,<br />
It became pretty sound.<br />
<br />
Amidst all the laughter,<br />
There was a missing chapter,<br />
That's when I saw you,<br />
My heart beats for you.<br />
<br />
A feeling so gentle,<br />
It blossomed to kindle,<br />
I fancied a big duet,<br />
And I became a poet.<br />
<br />
Oh, Gulmohar flower,<br />
With your witty fervour,<br />
Please don't kill me!<br />
Please don't hang me!<br />
<br />
I mustered up my courage,<br />
After days of forage,<br />
And gave you a flower,<br />
For you to be my lover.<br />
<br />
My heart stood like a rock,<br />
Feelings I had felt a block,<br />
I realised that you're a wall,<br />
Built on rocks strong and tall.<br />
<br />
I thought you'd say yes,<br />
And never did I guess,<br />
You would say no,<br />
My guts said so.<br />
<br />
I accepted in grace,<br />
And gave you some space,<br />
But I stayed in touch,<br />
My feelings held in a clutch.<br />
<br />
In the distance I admired,<br />
What your heart desired,<br />
Watched your subtle grace,<br />
The thoughts you embrace.<br />
<br />
Amidst a turbulent time,<br />
My heart did rhyme,<br />
And longed to say your name,<br />
And stir a passionate flame.<br />
<br />
With patience, I waited,<br />
My thoughts seated,<br />
Having tested time,<br />
Hoping your heart be mine.<br />
<br />
I gathered a lot of courage,<br />
Than what I could forage,<br />
I knocked on the door again,<br />
Despite the pouring rain.<br />
<br />
The door didn't budge,<br />
Not even a nudge,<br />
But I gained a trust,<br />
Firm and robust.<br />
<br />
I saw a glimpse,<br />
The thoughts you eclipse,<br />
A glimpse of many years,<br />
Sum of many fears.<br />
<br />
I saw you up-close,<br />
You're beautiful prose!<br />
Many ups and downs,<br />
Echoing many sounds.<br />
<br />
What can I honestly say?<br />
If you don't feel that way?<br />
I can't force you to sway,<br />
But it's hard to move away!<br />
<br />
In the moments I feel sad,<br />
Your thoughts drive me mad.<br />
With my feelings unclad,<br />
I felt terrible and bad.<br />
<br />
I prayed to the universe,<br />
For you to find your verse,<br />
For many a laurel,<br />
And friends so loyal.<br />
<br />
With a heavy heart,<br />
I take a fresh start,<br />
I have been so hard,<br />
On myself and scarred.<br />
<br />
You did not feel that way,<br />
After all, I had to say,<br />
Though my heart is in a sway,<br />
I decided to move away.<br />
<br />
I see my heart in pain,<br />
Of injuries deep and plain,<br />
I drift away to heal,<br />
And many voids to seal.<br />
<br />
I sail away far and wide,<br />
I have many waves to ride,<br />
I am always a riser,<br />
I keep growing wiser.<br />
<br />
If you feel for me later,<br />
Do write a big letter,<br />
Come out and take a walk,<br />
Let's meet out and talk.</div>

<div class="line-block">You worked with care,<br />
And crafted it all day,<br />
It is unique you swear,<br />
And you shout in gay.<br />
<br />
The reality hits you hard,<br />
When they say it's the same,<br />
You try to explain very hard,<br />
They still see it the same.<br />
<br />
It is scary this big fear,<br />
Of your work already done,<br />
By some unknown stranger,<br />
Who did it first and won.<br />
<br />
It does make you question,<br />
Are you truly special?<br />
It leaves a big impression,<br />
That you are not so special.<br />
<br />
Thus you strive to be unique,<br />
To make something new,<br />
By pushing away the antique,<br />
In the attempt, you grew.<br />
<br />
In the race to make a difference,<br />
Running hard to catch attention,<br />
You do show a lot of indifference,<br />
To the little things that need attention.<br />
<br />
But there is some comfort,<br />
To accept that you are normal,<br />
Do step out from the discomfort,<br />
And do behave quite informal.<br />
<br />
There is some sameness in everything,<br />
And what you do might be a repeat,<br />
When the task is finished and done,<br />
The experience you gained is a feat!<br />
<br />
Your existence alone is unique,<br />
The universe conspired to make you live,<br />
Although one day you'll be antique,<br />
You mark with memories the time you live.<br />
<br />
The photo you took with care,<br />
Might not be so unique,<br />
For you, it is quite rare,<br />
As that one is so unique.<br />
<br />
No matter what a hundred people feel,<br />
What you will do is unique,<br />
Your good work will make someone feel,<br />
That your work is unique.<br />
<br />
So it is alright if you fell in love,<br />
And spun a tale so cliched,<br />
The journey you take is all above,<br />
The jokes and tales so cliched.</div>
<h1 id="wandering-soul">Wandering Soul</h1>
<div class="line-block">Between right and wrong,<br />
Between madness and valour,<br />
Between past and future,<br />
A field of grey,<br />
A surreal feeling,<br />
A present moment,<br />
<br />
A singular moment,<br />
Where I wish time froze still,<br />
A conflicted feeling,<br />
Where I wish to cry and smile,<br />
A blurry field,<br />
Where I hope I am right,<br />
<br />
Like the still waters of a deep lake,<br />
The moon uses to admire its form,<br />
Keep calm, and be hopeful,<br />
Wherever I am, I'll find my way to you,<br />
For I am a sailor, aboard on a voyage,<br />
And you, my beloved, are my pole star,<br />
<br />
Like the bees that visit flowers,<br />
I wander in search of a treasure,<br />
Despite visiting many blossoms,<br />
The bee knows its way to its hive,<br />
Wherever I may go or be,<br />
My heart will beat your name,<br />
<br />
In times when I was lost, broken or hopeless,<br />
Drifting aimlessly on the tides of life,<br />
Even when the moon refused to show itself,<br />
I saw you twinkling on my night sky,<br />
Guiding me to the nearest shore,<br />
And you filled my heart with hope,<br />
<br />
I am a wanderer, venturing into the unknown,<br />
Filled with fear and valour in equal measure,<br />
But the bond I have with you,<br />
Is stronger than the mountain and land,<br />
Despite the uncertainty, one thing is clear,<br />
Because of you, a wanderer like me is never truly lost,</div>
<h1 id="where-are-you">Where are you?</h1>
<div class="line-block">In this world, with ever-changing rules,<br />
I'm losing hope, and running out of clues,<br />
Searching far and wide, in every other corner,<br />
Where are you now? I need you to be closer.<br />
<br />
Some days are hard, without your company,<br />
The heart often does, misses your symphony,<br />
How far can I run, away from my reality?<br />
Where are you now? My life is a tragedy.<br />
<br />
Once I looked, in the Mirror of Erised,<br />
And I saw your face, the one I desired.<br />
Will you ever come, the person of my dreams?<br />
Where are you now? My heart does scream.<br />
<br />
I tried so hard, amidst all odds,<br />
Even as an atheist, I prayed to all gods.<br />
I am a broken glass, fallen and shattered,<br />
Where are you now? I feel quite scattered.<br />
<br />
When did I lose you, I do not know,<br />
Did I ever have you, I could not know?<br />
All I do know, is I've felt your fragrance,<br />
Where are you now? I want your presence.<br />
<br />
My muscles do ache, yet I keep walking,<br />
On the journey of life, that's quite tiring,<br />
I try hard, to know more my true self,<br />
Where are you now? My true inner self?</div>
<h1 id="wild-lily">Wild Lily</h1>
<div class="line-block">I have charm, to win my foes over,<br />
Wild and crazy, yet gentle and naive.<br />
I am independent, a walking sensation,<br />
With a touch of the devil, in an angelic heart.<br />
<br />
I smile so brightly, the sunflowers look at me,<br />
I dance with joy, in the rainiest of days.<br />
When I walk with anger, the very land trembles,<br />
When I am happy, I float like a feather.<br />
<br />
The breeze is my friend, carrying my scent across,<br />
Don't try to bind me; I'll never be yours.<br />
See my nature, the good and ugly side,<br />
Touch my soul; my heart is yours.<br />
<br />
A spark always twinkles, in my black eyes,<br />
A spark of love, a spark for mischief.<br />
I am the laughter, you hear through the forest,<br />
Blossoming above the pond, I am a wild lily.</div>
<h1 id="wise-panda">Wise Panda</h1>
<div class="line-block">Once you were quiet and shy,<br />
For reasons don't know why.<br />
After you freely opened up,<br />
It's difficult to shut you up.<br />
<br />
With an eye to capture colours,<br />
Your photos are true wonders.<br />
You observe every detail,<br />
And nuances without fail.<br />
<br />
Chirpy and lively as an extrovert,<br />
But deep down a big introvert.<br />
Fierce and crazy full of charm<br />
Kind and caring and warm.<br />
<br />
While some are a symphony,<br />
You genuinely are a rhapsody.<br />
Hard to say if you're ice or fire,<br />
But you are a friend to desire.<br />
<br />
You observe all the people around,<br />
Your wisdom is quite truly profound.<br />
Your heart is finite, yet<br />
Your love for friends is infinite.<br />
<br />
Talking with you is such ease,<br />
Fun and lively with a bit of tease.<br />
After your arrival life is colourful,<br />
This is the start of something beautiful.</div>
<h1 id="wishes-to-a-budding-artist">Wishes to a Budding Artist</h1>
<div class="line-block">While all of us see colours,<br />
You leapt to use them,<br />
When we think the world is grey,<br />
You showed the colours we couldn't see,<br />
<br />
How does it feel? To view the world,<br />
In all its best, in all its worst?<br />
To see every little thing, even the soul?<br />
And choose to mimic the magic it has?<br />
<br />
You are no god, but I see a resemblance,<br />
When your works convey, a deeper meaning,<br />
Nuanced yet straightforward, with attention to detail,<br />
I admire your effort; I find it endearing,<br />
<br />
As you step forward, ready to leap,<br />
I wish you all success and an abundance of health,<br />
Keep the embers burning, and the colours flowing,<br />
Happy birthday to you, my budding artist!</div>
<h1 id="wishes-to-a-noble-friend">Wishes to a Noble Friend</h1>
<div class="line-block">The White moon is shining,<br />
Following wherever you go!,<br />
Surprisingly for you and unknown to all,<br />
The moon carried the stars for you!<br />
<br />
While you walk in your journey ahead,<br />
With no time to stop and look,<br />
The moon shall stop and make you speak,<br />
With pleasant dews in pure heart,<br />
<br />
Let the path you go shall be known to all,<br />
As a path that all shall dare to take,<br />
Forging your road you shall gallop ahead,<br />
Gentle as the breeze and wild as a mustang,<br />
<br />
Your life shall fill with lively colours,<br />
Pink in health and White in heart,<br />
With rosy smiles and lively eyes,<br />
The world will be from violet to red!<br />
<br />
As you walk in your journey ahead,<br />
Companions many shall journey aside,<br />
I wish them all to be cheerful as you,<br />
With bonds so strong like the larks themselves,<br />
<br />
I wish for a day, soon in the wild,<br />
When the moon shall be, a person indeed,<br />
Sweeping your feet off and stealing your heart,<br />
You shall be together like the bread and butter,<br />
<br />
Together as a couple, while your love blooms,<br />
Out shall come the songs, sweet as your hearts,<br />
Melting the world and charming the time,<br />
Nature in ease, will make you live in peace,<br />
<br />
As you take a leap ahead,<br />
Be grateful to all who helped,<br />
As you climb the ladders for glory,<br />
I am prideful with your epic story!<br />
<br />
Like the warm sun that lights the world,<br />
Like the pleasant moon that guides the awe,<br />
Live long and prosper for years!<br />
My dear and noble friend!</div>
<h1 id="you-are-special">You are Special</h1>
<div class="line-block">None can imagine, what you went through,<br />
There might be days; you wanted to end it all,<br />
I am sorry, I didn't comprehend,<br />
The suffering and pain, the tears and scars.<br />
<br />
You never thought, the tragedies of life,<br />
A cruel joke, to be a victim of it.<br />
Enough of the days, you hid behind a smile,<br />
You deserve more, and this is not the end.<br />
<br />
A thousand doors might close, but never fear,<br />
If you end it all, you won't see it through.<br />
You have a gift, a precious life,<br />
No sorrow in the world is worth its price.<br />
<br />
You are unique, In this ever-changing world,<br />
Hold my hand; you are not alone.<br />
It is excruciating, but be firm,<br />
Your winter will leave, and spring will come!</div>
