                <h1>Realising the two Wolves inside us</h1>

<h2><strong>Are we missing something?</strong></h2>

<p>From the very moment we, the humans began our existence in this world,
we faced so many issues. While on the one hand, we are remarkably
intelligent and we evolved far better than other species in this planet,
the animal nature existing in ourselves, despite so much progressive
development is hard to comprehend.</p>

<p>Looking at human history, episodes of savage killings, sufferings,
warfare, domination, oppression etc., are plenty. While nature and other
external factors were responsible for the survival of species, for
humans, however, the ironical situation was (and is) that our species
was responsible for controlling our population. What is more ironic is
that unlike other less intelligent species, we, the &quot;intelligent&quot;
species are fighting among ourselves in manners that are sometimes more
vicious, cruel and cold-blooded than what other species do. On paper,
one would argue that intelligent species would live in harmony, with
fewer quarrels. With this failing dramatically, it is evident that
apparently, something else drives us deep down.</p>

<h2>The Human Mind and its conflicts.</h2>

<p>Several people share the view that we humans are complex creatures
emotionally. We all have wants and drives. One simplified way of looking
at human behaviour is to understand that every human has an inner
conflict. When the battle to deal with is simple, rationality, logic and
emotions are well within control, and it is easy to make choices. It is
when we deal with more significant, more complicated and convoluted
conflicts, is when we realise that in such cases, the conflict and its
connection with morality is weak; in such situation, the conflict is not
about right or wrong, but rather what people feel it is right or wrong
in their Point of View (POV), however right or wrong their POV might be.</p>

<p>For instance, with all conditions ideal, the act of stealing is
considered immoral. If one wants something or wants to achieve
something, the ideal way to do is to earn the way through: work hard,
work smart, plan well and reach the goal. This is a hard way no doubt.
And the sincere efforts put by one in this process makes it a noble
attempt, regardless of the outcome it can fetch. Another way to do is
stealing. Although there are many ways, given these two options, why do
some people chose to cheat, while some prefer the hard way? It is the
consequence and the aftermaths and the compromises/sacrifices one has to
make along the way. Added to that, <strong>*what drives even harder is the
tenacity to deal with the consequences and aftermaths to be followed. It
should not be surprising that the options we have, the alternatives we
can, the price to be paid, the uncertainty, and how emotionally healthy
we are all critical</strong>*.</p>

<p>One Example:</p>

<p>To explain this clearly, let narrate an episode in the US TV series
called as House MD (House (TV Series 2004--2012)) Although this entire
episode revolves around honesty and its virtue, it narrates the essence
of the conflicting nature of our human mind, the choices we make, what
we think is right/wrong in our POV, the consequences/aftermath one can
face/will face, the price/sacrifice one has to make etc.,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In one episode, a lady is brought to the hospital after a car
accident. She was having some form of involuntary jerks in her hands
and legs which caused the accident. At the end of the episode, it was
found that the involuntary jerks that almost killed her, were a
symptom of a more significant health issue that gradually developed
due to her medications and habits. She was undergoing a steady
physical and mental degradation.</p>

<p>It turns out she was suffering from Ritalin abuse and hepatocellular
adenoma.</p>

<p>Although her disease is not the prime concern here, what is important
is how she acquired it.</p>

<p>She has a five-year-old daughter from a previous marriage. She
divorced and married another person. With her new husband, she was a
full-time housewife and a very active one. She had a lot of energy to
take care of the house and do so many extra activities altogether that
kept her thoroughly busy. The couple were loving each other truly, and
they settle any issue they have peacefully. The guy was understanding
and caring, and he treated and loved her daughter as his own.</p>

<p>Sounds like a happy story so far right? Here comes the twist.</p>

<p>The lady&#39;s husband wants to have a biological child with her. (The guy
is her husband, and so this is not wrong right?).</p>

<p>So what did she do? She agreed to his request. And, since they were in
their 30&#39;s, they decided to take fertility treatments to increase the
chances of conception. And, behind his back and intentionally, she was
taking contraceptives to avoid conception at any cost.</p>

<p>These polar opposite actions took a toll on her physically, and the
guilt was wearing her mentally. To keep herself preoccupied so that
she does not think about this, she became a Ritalin abuser. That gave
her the energy to do so much stuff and kept her problems at bay.
However, the combined actions of all three medications caused her
physical and mental degradation and the hepatocellular adenoma.</p>

<p>The doctors finally figured out all of this after so many painstaking
efforts. When the doctors confronted her in person, she honestly
confessed her emotions. Honestly, she was not willing to have another
child at all!</p>

<p>She was so happy to be married to her new husband. He was perfect,
caring, understanding and a great guy. But, she was very firm and
stern not to have any children with him or anyone else. She wanted
that for her reason and also believed that having a biological child
with him would make him care more for the new baby (since it will be
his blood) and care less about her already existing daughter.</p>

<p>But, she did not want to confront him and tell the truth. She feared
that if she says so, then,</p>

<ul>
<li>  They might fight, and the marriage might break apart</li>
<li>  He will not at all be happy and will never forgive her</li>
<li>  He might divorce her.</li>
</ul>

<p>She did not want to lose him, and at the same time, she did not want
him to have another child. Hence, she agreed to his request to have
another child and still intentionally did not grant him that wish.</p>

<p>When the doctors asked her as to how long she intended to play along
like this, she said that for a few more years till they both reach
their 40&#39;s.</p>

<p>Her rationalisation is as follows: Since they are in their thirties,
they would try to get pregnant until they reach about forties. Beyond
that, their fertility would drop gradually with age to the point that
the fertility treatments would be of no use. Besides, she will reach
menopause, and beyond that, it is of no use. She was willing to bet on
the fact that, with the years of continuous failure to get pregnant
would gradually put him down, curb his enthusiasm and eventually, he
will accept the fact that they can&#39;t have babies and stop trying
altogether. And, in this process, the guilt of not having a child of
his own would make him accept her daughter as his own more firmly
because he was a great guy.</p>

<p>Well, at this point, both the viewers and doctors were taken aback by
her reasoning.</p>

<p>The story for that episode ends with the lady persisting to her
initial ideas despite the agony she suffered and pledging honestly to
the doctors that she will not let her health degrade like this. The
husband, on the other hand, is kept in the dark about the deception.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Such is the complexity of some conflicts that runs in ourselves
sometimes.</p>

<p><strong>*Honesty is, sometimes, a bitter pill to swallow.</strong>*</p>

<h2>Dissecting the example:</h2>

<p>If you look at the point of view of the lady in the story, she is partly
right and partly wrong. The price she and her husband have to pay is a
lot. Had she taken a leap of faith and confessed her true intentions,
then yes, there is a chance that things would go bad as she feared. But
then there is at least a probability that he would understand. Or, there
was a chance that they could have a baby, and still, everything can end
happily.</p>

<p>On her part, she might feel that being dishonest is the best thing to do
to keep the marriage safe. But, if she has to be dishonest to have the
marriage stay strong, then she is not in a stable marriage in the first
place.</p>

<p>I felt sympathy for the character. By not confronting the situation
(however bitter or sweet it might turn out to be), and following up with
the deception, she is merely refusing to face reality. Her insecurity of
her child may not be having a loving father genuinely out weighted an
alternate reality wherein her husband would understand her. I felt that
she should have opened the box to see if the Schrödinger\&#39;s cat is alive
or not instead of letting her insecurity overwhelm her to believe that
the cat is dead.</p>

<h2>The power of negative emotions:</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Luke: Come with me. Leave everything behind.</p>

<p>Darth Vader: Obi-Wan once thought as you do. You don\&#39;t know the power
of the Dark Side. I must obey my master.</p>

<p>-- Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We all have tough decisions to make in various stages of life. Negative
drives such as fear of rejection/losing/embarrassment, have great
convincing powers over our decisions. They tend to force, cheat, trick
or manipulate you to do something as if the price one pays for it is
nothing. They comfort us, feeds our insecurity, do gets us what we want
sometimes. But in the process, it makes us unfit for the things we
aimed. The things we get through these emotions do not last long. There
is a strong irony with this. You get what you want, but you become unfit
to have it. You get it, but you lose so many things knowingly or
unknowingly in the long run. You get it, and you later might throw that
away because you missed the importance, You might get the short-term
benefit, but the long-term benefit is gone. It gives so many material
things to you, but takes away your soul. By the time you realise the
price you paid is too much, things would be way out of hand to turn
back.</p>

<h2>The power of positive emotions:</h2>

<p>The value of honesty, in contrast to the above, is that it respects your
free will and makes you aware that one is accountable. It makes you
stronger by letting you face your fears, pushing you out of your comfort
zone by telling you the issues on your face and making you strive for
those despite that. It gives you courage. There is no manipulation, just
plain facts. It is not a significant driving force, but honesty is a
quality that makes one appreciates his/her limits and capacities. It
grows trust, compassion and reliability and makes strong connections
within yourself and with the people around you. It helps you to
eliminate bad influences and bad people. Most importantly, the most
critical value of honesty is that it enables you to see the reality as
it is, free from fantasies and delusions.</p>

<p>That leads to another important concept: honesty alone is never
sufficient. Honesty provides a foundation of trust and reliability.
Aided by truth and other good qualities and strong positive motivation,
life will be peaceful, no matter what happens in your life.</p>

<h2>The two wolves:</h2>

<p>This will concur with the teachings told throughout the world such as
the Yin and Yang, The Teachings of Bhagavad Gita of Hinduism, etc.,</p>

<p>The Two Wolves is a Cherokee legend which goes as below,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An old Cherokee is teaching his grandson about life. &quot;A fight is going
on inside me,&quot; he said to the boy.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a terrible fight, and it is between two wolves. One is evil --
It is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt,
resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.&quot; He
continued, &quot;The other is good -- he is joy, peace, love, hope,
serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth,
compassion, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you -- and
inside every other person, too.&quot;</p>

<p>The grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his
grandfather, &quot;Which wolf will win?&quot;</p>

<p>The old Cherokee simply replied, &quot;The one you feed.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, clearly &quot;We&quot; are the &quot;Feeders&quot; of the wolves.</p>

<h2>Why we need it more than ever?</h2>

<p>Delving deeper into these lines and looking at all the worldly problems
we face, all of them are because we feed the evil wolf among us.</p>

<p>Unlike the world several years ago, the world is more connected and
accessible today, and it will continue to be more of it in the future
years. While this is good, it comes with a price. It has become more
sensitive.</p>

<p>A long time ago, the power vested in us humans is limited. Hence, when
we had a massive flood or an outbreak of disease etc., we had nothing in
our means to fight against them or do anything. All we could do is
accept it as a bitter fact of life and move on.</p>

<p>Now, with our every growing power, more and more of the constraints we
faced earlier are vanishing. The authority and freedom vested in us is
so large these days that it is near impossibility for humans several
centuries ago. While the removal of constraints is good, it also causes
significant ramifications because this can lead to the misuse of freedom
and power if there is no moral support. Also, due to such a stance,
having the power and yet not using it properly (or worse making a
mistake) can be even more costly.</p>

<p>As a consequence, in contrast to the past, it is easier to wage war,
easier to offend, easier to get cheated etc., While the ever-growing
powers make us comfortable and civilised, removing that makes many of us
more barbaric and uncivilised in greater proportions than before due to
the lack of morality.</p>

<p>Who can forget the amount of destruction caused by World War II - the
most expensive war (by the human lives lost, countries involved, money
invested) of the human kind? Is it not much easier to form major
terrorist groups in this era than before? Global warming could not be
possible a long time ago, and now it is real!</p>

<p>While the future is wide open with so many exciting possibilities and
challenges, one can find it easy to imagine the lives of so many people
can change for the worse at the press of a button. This is scary ---
terrifying, and it is sending chills down the spine.</p>

<p>Let us all feed the good wolf inside us!</p>
