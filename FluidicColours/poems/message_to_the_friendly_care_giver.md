Message to the friendly care giver
==================================

| Turning another leaf, as you go around the sun,
| You might wonder and ponder, what's going on?
| Your purpose in life, and what you're doing with it,
| The days that pass by and the days yet to come.
| 
| A new leaf at this age can be quite taxing,
| With the world in a pandemic, it is harder than usual.
| While you work hard, to reach your dreams and goals,
| What can I say to you, my friendly caregiver?
| 
| This is no advice, as the world has it in suffice,
| Just thoughts and words, that could be soothing.
| Do reach out to them, when you're in need,
| I'll be delighted to know if this helped you in some way.
| 
| You are a dreamer, in this practical world,
| And you might seem misplaced, and rightly so.
| But the practical world, can't exist at all,
| If your kind was not born at all!
|
| That is the power, of dreams and visions,
| It is the one, that can contort reality,
| Into ways and means, the non-dreamers can't see,
| And makes the impossible, possible by good means.
| 
| Dare to dream big, and dare to push your limits,
| You don't have to be, the dutiful adult you are,
| Once in a while, listen to your inner child,
| No one can be as selfless as an innocent child.
| 
| An empath at heart, you care for animals more,
| For you say, that they behave better than people.
| While it is true, in many many accounts,
| I request you to not, shut your door on people.
| 
| Like the clouds that can hide the sun,
| Many vices from humans, can hide humanity,
| But do be strong, and notice humans more,
| For there is still hope, and hope is not lost.
|
| While you are special, special in many ways,
| Do keep in mind, that you are a human too,
| You have your own many quirks and flaws,
| That makes you unique, and one of a kind.
| 
| Do show yourself a lot of kindness,
| The same kindness you show to others.
| Especially when you're hurt and sad,
| Especially when you feel inadequate.
| 
| There is an abundance of goodness around us,
| And there is an abundance of evil too!
| It is a daily fight, to preserve the goodness in us,
| And it is tough, to fight darkness every day.
| 
| This fight is hard when your goals are different,
| And even harder to convince, the unwilling hearts,
| It is quite alright, to feel lost at these times,
| With time and planning, you will surely win.
|
| It is quite painful when hurt by the ones you love,
| It can be scary, to trust people back again,
| Do take your time, to heal from the pain,
| And ask help when needed, we can sort it out.
| 
| When you feel down, sad, or lost,
| Do take some time, and take it slow,
| Give yourself time, to heal and recover,
| Show yourself patience, to bounce back better.
| 
| Ash turns to Diamond, amidst all the pressure,
| With support, you will become a diamond too!
| So aim high, and take the chances and risks,
| We're here to support you, you'll be fine!
| 
| Whenever you feel sad, and feel hopeless,
| Do keep in mind, a simple metaphor in life,
| Happiness and sadness comes in waves,
| And as they say, waves don't stay for long.
|
| You have the strength, and power within you,
| Take your time, and harness it with conviction,
| A person of substance, you're one of a kind,
| An infinite universe, in a finite human being.
| 
| This is your life, my dear caregiver!
| You have the right, to make it as you please!
| Listen to your heart, for what is right and wrong,
| And build the courage to follow it through.
| 
| Do surround yourself, with people who love you,
| For they can either, make you or break you,
| You care for others a lot, despite your troubles,
| Do let the ones you love, take care of you too?
| 
| Don't hesitate to shine, as radiant as the sun,
| And dare to fill, the dark cosmos with light.
| In your own pace, and in your own time,
| For you are special, the child of the sun!
