Wishes to an Akikaze
====================

| I don't know if I'll meet you again,
| So I cherish all the moments with you.
| I fear that things are not the same again,
| And I feel a drift between us, do you?
| 
| The winds of winter were quite harsh,
| Despire the cold, you managed to thrive.
| I feel like stuck, in a thick green marsh,
| Still searching, for a destination to arrive.
| 
| When the winter came, it hit you quite hard,
| Although you said little, your scars ran deep.
| I feel helpless, to see your hopes marred,
| But I'm there for you, to help you take a leap.
| 
| While it is true, that your journey is different,
| I made a promise to look after you.
| I will be there for you, not like a deterrent,
| But as a breeze, kindling the spirits in you.
| 
| You tried hard, to keep others happy,
| And in the journey, you hurt yourself badly.
| Now that you choose to keep yourself happy,
| I'm happy for you, and I'll support you gladly.
| 
| What shall be of us? I let the fate decide!
| Regardless the ending, I'll be your friend!
| Now go Akikaze! Flow with grace and pride!
| You'll be fine and fit for your great ascend!
