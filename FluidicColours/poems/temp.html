<h1 id="you-will-reap">You will reap</h1>
<div class="line-block">All that is random will make sense,<br />
All the loose ends, will one day connect,<br />
The time will come, and your wait will end,<br />
The bounty you seek shall be plenty.<br />
<br />
All your efforts will now bear fruits,<br />
The world will see, and praise your efforts,<br />
Though you’re lost, you’ll find your way back,<br />
The ones you desire will fulfil.<br />
<br />
All your struggles will polish you,<br />
And you will glow, more than mere glitter,<br />
Your frozen heart, will one day thaw,<br />
And the embers will burn, brighter than ever.<br />
<br />
The love in your heart will spring again,<br />
All the withering hopes will rise again,<br />
You will visit, all the places you dreamt,<br />
And the world will sing, of your beautiful tale.<br />
<br />
A fire shall rise, from the ashes like a phoenix,<br />
The fire in your heart will give out light,<br />
The light will push, all your shadows away,<br />
And it will conquer, all your demons forever.<br />
<br />
All these hardships and pains shall pass,<br />
Your winter will break, and your spring isn’t far,<br />
All the seed you’ve sown will rise from the ground,<br />
And they shall bear fruits, that you will reap.</div>
