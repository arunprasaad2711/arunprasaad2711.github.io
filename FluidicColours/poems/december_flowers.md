December Flowers
================

| I look at you all, through the window,
| I see you all, gathered in the meadow,
| Basking in the cold, between the snow,
| Fluttering gracefully to the breeze's flow.
| 
| I look at you all, and I deeply wonder,
| How you stand, despite the cold's sunder?
| I always hope and pray to be very sure,
| Yet it lingers: the fear of making a blunder.
| 
| Why do I fear? I can't vividly say,
| As my thoughts now, are quite gray.
| Sitting in the snow, I always tend to wonder,
| When to put a fight, and when to walk away?
| 
| You lovely flowers, you are hardly a day old.
| Yet you stand and fight, despite the bitter cold.
| Budding against the snow, and flakes that befall,
| Where do you get the strength to be so bold?
| 
| I used to feel a lot, in extremes in the past,
| Now I feel nothing, the pain to cold quite lost.
| To stand and feel nothing, undeterred by the cold,
| Is this a gift of worth? Or is it a sunken cost?
| 
| I can't tell for sure, if I became quite strong,
| But never was I this bold in life for this long.
| Did I become one of you? Tell me december flowers!
| Despite the cold I'm fluttering, and singing a song.
