To new Beginnings
=================

| On this new day, we step into a new year,
| Another chance, to start again without feat.
| An old chapter in life comes to a close,
| A new chapter awaits, for us to choose.
| 
| On this new day, let’s look back at the past,
| And let go causes that are truly lost.
| Like the birds that shed their old feathers,
| It’s time we leave all the unwanted tethers.
| 
| It is indeed true that we cannot change the past,
| But we are not our past’s cast!
| We have the power, strength, and skill,
| To forge our future and shape it to our will.
| 
| Let this day be the start of a new beginning!
| A reset in life, like a fresh cricket match inning!
| Let this year be different from the others,
| A year for you to shine with flying colours.
| 
| There is a place, far far away,
| That you want to go there someday,
| That place, far far away,
| You will reach there someday.
| 
| To new beginnings, to find your spirits back!
| To new beginnings, to more excitement in life!
| To new beginnings, for happiness and health!
| To new beginnings, for eternal sunshine!
