<p>It was one cloudy Saturday evening with signs of potential rainfall.
I just came out of my therapy session, visited an aeronautical museum
and was planning for something fun on the go. The rainy skies worried
me; what if it rains when I come back? Nevertheless, I took the risk and
went to a gaming arena for an evening filled with games and fun. There,
after a fun 7 minutes of go-karting, I decided to give a shot at cricket
inside nets in the gaming arena.</p>
<p>The gaming setup was quite simple: I have to face a mechanical
ball-pitching machine that shoots cricket balls mimicking the delivery
action of bowlers. I have to wear a helmet, leg pads, a pair of gloves,
and hold a cricket bat to hit the balls as far as possible to score the
most runs.</p>
<p>In the back of my mind, I had this thought: It’s just a simple
cricket game. Why all this precaution? What could happen? Well, I just
had to wait for a few minutes to realise why.</p>
<p>The one who played before me did an excellent job; He scored about 30
runs in 3 overs with each ball thrown at an average speed of 60 km/hr.
It’s my turn now. The person-in-charge asked me for the speed setting. I
naively told him that this setting is alright — my mistake.</p>
<p>Anyway, when I entered, It didn’t take me long enough to realise my
mistake. Perhaps the first ball itself was enough. The speed of the
deliveries was too fast that I couldn’t even fathom them. I barely
managed to touch a ball, let alone hit them for boundaries or
single.</p>
<p>In the 8th, 9th, and 10th deliveries, I lost a wicket in each ball.
The 11th ball was the most annoying one of all. I haven’t scored a
single run, lost three wickets, and was stressed out to score a single
run.</p>
<p>In my attempt to hit a ball for at least one run, my bat missed the
ball, and my little finger on my right hand made contact. I knew for a
fact that my finger broke. The pain was intense, and I snatched my hand
away from my bat and was shaking my wrist and fingers involuntarily. I
asked the person-in-charge to pause the game.</p>
<p>I carefully removed my gloves to see my little finger swollen nearly
twice its width and in dark pink colour. I couldn’t even touch my
finger. After applying some pain-relieving spray as suggested by the
person-in-charge, the person-in-charge advised me that there is a slower
speed setting that I can take. That came as a surprise! I didn’t know
that!</p>
<p>I took his suggestion and accepted a slower speed setting. Instead of
an average speed of 60 km/hr, the speed of the deliveries reduced to 40
km/hr. It was fortunate for me. Despite a broken finger, I managed to
hit the balls with ease for sixes and fours. With only seven shots, I
brought the score to 25 — not bad at all.</p>
<p>This incident made me rethink a few aspects of life that I forgot to
see. My Master’s degree and my failed research attempts in the past were
stressful. My depression reached its peaks during the five years I
invested in my masters and my research. Even without depression,
investing your time in masters and research without a break can be
stressful. Depression, ambitious targets, disturbed sleep-cycle, a fear
of future, lack of regard to health, and a lot of stress lead me to
abandon my research to take a break.</p>
<h2 id="everyone-needs-time-and-space">Everyone needs time and
space</h2>
<p>Being a staunch idealist and a dreamer, I cannot look and embark on a
life without a plan. I always had one that spanned several years. At the
least, I had a sketch of what I wanted to do for several years and had
hoped to figure things out as I proceed along with the milestones.</p>
<p>With the original plan to finish my PhD, get a post-doc, do research,
and then become a professor at stake, I have decided to spend two years
setting things right. I am taking therapy to handle my depression
better, get my health back on track — especially my sleep cycle.</p>
<p>It took me a while to come to terms with the standards I have set for
myself. It was way high than what I could achieve.</p>
<p>Reflecting, maybe if I had been a bit easy on myself, I could’ve been
a bit stress-free. Instead of doing things with a fiery passion at
stretches, if I had done them regularly — aka with discipline and
routine — Things could have been better.</p>
<p>More than the discipline, the anxiety and fear reaching the standards
brought became too much to bear.</p>
<p>Looking back, a part of me was a bit arrogant and stubborn that I
could do all of it by myself. I like my independence and the fact that
asking help or taking a practical solution instead of a novel one felt
too cheap.</p>
<p>What I didn’t realise was that I was hurting myself like King
Sisyphus trying to push a rock against a steep hill.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>That rest, my body craved was essential. That space, I craved to
forget about work was crucial. That break, I should’ve taken was vital.
I needed some quality space and some alone time for myself. One might
think that it only takes away time. On the contrary, that break helps
you recover, recuperate and even realign yourself with your plan.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="accepting-that-i-gave-my-best-was-helpful">Accepting that I gave
my best was helpful</h2>
<p>In all the unsuccessful events that happened in the last few years, I
had been too critical of myself. I have been intolerant of my
short-comings, and I have felt that I am not doing my best.</p>
<p>It was instead a surprise when I realised from my friend and peers
that I had put in a lot of efforts than what I thought.</p>
<p>I’m not the type to give up easily — It is in my nature to try very
hard before giving up. Even when the odds were against me, I tried my
best to fight back. So, me trying to give up on a dream I was building
over several years was too painful.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I lost, sometimes I gave up, sometimes I won. At the end of
the day, regardless of winning or losing, what gave me solace was the
fact that I gave my best. Yes, losing is disappointing, and it can be
demotivating. But knowing that I gave my best not only helped me accept
the reality, but also put me on the path of a speedy recovery.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While I was busy cribbing about my incompetencies, I was not paying
attention to how much I grew and matured in the past few years. My
writing improved, my articulation of thoughts developed, and for the
better or worse, the high standards I set for myself helped me realise
what I can do and what I cannot do.</p>
<h2 id="your-true-nature-wont-change">Your true nature won’t change</h2>
<p>One of the biggest fears I had before quitting my research was that
I’d lose this research temperament to learn. I’ve heard and seen many
many people who are not in touch with studies or learning that I was
worried that I might become one.</p>
<p>As I write this article, It’s been nearly a year since I left
research and I cannot be more wrong. Even now, I’ve been consistently
active reading about psychology, cognitive functions, Myers-Briggs type
indicators, Jungian Typology, interpersonal relationships, and not to
mention: science, mathematics and programming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you’re good at something, and you’ve committed yourself to
maintain that, it is unlikely for your nature to change.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite being away from research for a year, my subject knowledge is
still strong. And the motivation to learn something new is still fresh.
It is stronger than what it was before. Added to that, I’m better than
before. So, if at all something bothers me, I’m able to overcome that
easily.</p>
<h2 id="finding-my-pace">Finding my pace</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most important thing I realised is the pace. Just like
how I was able to score better when the speed setting was adjusted,
there is a sweet spot where I’ll perform well. Working in a corporate in
my break away from research as a content developer has reinforced my
need to evaluate the optimal pace which is comfortable for me to be
productive, yet has the potential for me to grow and adapt.</p>
<p>Finding the pace suitable for me has been hard. At different times, a
different pace suited my need. I’ll say that it is a work in
progress.</p>
<h2 id="to-conclude">To conclude</h2>
<p>To say that I realised all of this came up due to a broken finger is
giving the incident a lot of undue importance. It’s not that the pain of
a fractured finger suddenly brought me insight into all of this.</p>
<p>All of these were happening on its own. The realisations,
reflections, the therapy were bringing all these issues on the
table.</p>
<p>Well, then what did my broken finger achieve?</p>
<p>Imagine yourself sleeping soundly. You want to wake up so badly, but
the comforts of your bed instead make you rest for some time more. One
more minute, you crave. But you know that if you give in to that one
more minute, you’ll sleep for a few hours and your entire day will be at
stake. You need that one jump-start to wake you up. It can be your
friend knocking on your door, or someone screaming that your house
is — allegedly — on fire. Or rather, it could be the splash of cold
water poured on your face to wake up from sleep.</p>
<p>You’ll be annoyed by the discomfort any one of the above events
could’ve caused you. However, secretly, you’ll be thankful for that
event.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I’m thankful for my broken finger! And I’m looking
forward to — metaphorically — more broken fingers! :)</p>
