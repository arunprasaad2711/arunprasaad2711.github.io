<p>This post might sound like a rant. While it is right in a way, the
underlying issue is subtle and painful. I feel this issue often and have
seen many many people face this directly or indirectly to the point it
leaves a bad taste in my mouth when I look at it or hear it.</p>
<p>So here I go ...</p>
<p>Once while reading the comic strips of "Calvin and Hobbes" by Bill
Watterson, I came across one piece that made me ponder.</p>
<p>The titular character Calvin scored a C grade in a test while his
friend Suzy gets an A. Despite getting a lower grade, Calvin was happy.
When asked he said that people wouldn't expect a lot from him, and that
way he'll be satisfied.</p>
<p>That was a curious way to see it. During school, and even in college,
there was a pressure on me to do well and keep the grades up. I loved
studying, and it was fun for the most part, and thus, I did study well
without the need for external motivation.</p>
<p>But then again, when I look back at my past, I felt that I could have
been happier with less pressure on my head. I am glad that I got good
grades and performed very well and all. Sometimes I feel that even if I
had taken things a bit lightly, I would have ended up in the same place
where I am, only less troubled and even happier.</p>
<p>While some of you know this, but in case you didn't know, I was
suffering from Depression and Anxiety disorder for the past five years.
When I tried to understand why it happened to me, I consulted a
psychologist, and she suggested that I am a perfectionist; and that is
making me unhappy.</p>
<p>Like a reflex, I refused to accept her explanation citing that I am
anything except that. She told me to think about that and meet her the
next time and explain what happened. I went back and reflected, and to
my surprise, subconsciously I was.</p>
<p>As to how I became a perfectionist, I think it was because I was
putting a lot of expectations on myself. Reflecting upon what happened
in the past in various incidents, a lot of people put a lot of
expectations on me. While I loved helping people, somehow down the line
the always high expectations got imbibed into me. So, I got to a point
where even when people didn't expect much from me, I started
interpreting that they wanted a lot. In this regard, imagine what
disappointments would feel.</p>
<p>I guess somewhere in late 2013 and early 2014, the mounting pressure
I subconsciously built for myself snapped, and I felt lost. I thought
that I wouldn't be able to meet all my expectations and hence I won't be
happy at all. And I know for sure that it was that singular moment that
put me in Depression.</p>
<p>As to why people put a lot of expectations, maybe because I was
available way too often. It could be that I was going out of my way to
reach unreasonable and unrealistic targets. Or perhaps it is because I
was not at all saying "no" where I should have. Maybe it is because I
did not set boundaries correctly; Perhaps I should have put my foot down
firm and took a big stand.</p>
<p>There are many maybes here. Each one suited a particular
situation.</p>
<p>There were a few events that bothered me a lot in this process. One
of those issues was when I had a tough time with my PhD. Due to a
variety of reasons I submitted my resignation. One of my so-called
"friend" messaged me hearing my troubles and decisions from other
friends and said he/she was "Disappointed" that I did not share the
problem with him/her. I was outside and travelling at that time, and so
I could not meet him/her. And when I asked how he/she got to know about
this problem, he/she refused to answer and stopped.</p>
<p>A few days later, when I came back to the campus, he/she called me. I
thought he/she wanted to meet me in person to talk about my issues.
Instead, he/she invited me to ask if I can come to his/her lab and help
his/her code run correctly.</p>
<p>That left a bad taste in my mouth. I mean, this person was feeling
okay to call me casually to help him/her fix a trivial programming
issue, whereas he/she could only text me when his/her so-called friend
is in a career crisis? Was that all I am? A so-called problem solver,
ready to be called out when one is running in hot water?</p>
<p>That is one of many examples wherein I saw many people look at me
like a disposable tool to get their job done and forget about me later.
The first thing that came to many of these people was that I am an
intelligent person and things are a cake walk for me.</p>
<p>To break the myth, it was never easy.</p>
<p>I guess only a few people knew me truly and cared for me. Just these
people saw the full picture of what I am and realised that I am more
than what meets the eye. I am immensely grateful for them.</p>
<p>Other than a rant, what am I trying to say here?</p>
<p>You are more than your gift. Stop seeing people for one single trait
they have. Especially yourself. If one person is a teacher, or a writer,
or intelligent, or a painter etc., then that is not the only thing that
defines them. That is a gift, either obtained by birth or developed over
time.</p>
<p>Seeing such people for only one aspect and disregarding or being
indifferent to all other factors and traits is IMHO, objectification of
the first order.</p>
