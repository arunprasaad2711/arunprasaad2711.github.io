Phoenix</h1>
<div class="line-block">Among the group there stood one,<br />
Unnoticed by the common ones,<br />
Who wanders around wide and far,<br />
Curious and kind, her nature by far,<br />
<br />
Full of hope and full of care,<br />
With a heart overflowing to dare,<br />
While people walk away with others,<br />
She spreads awe in a dance of colours,<br />
<br />
While I walked in a colourless planet,<br />
Minding my work and winding my life,<br />
She flashed into my life as a sonnet,<br />
And changed my life with the dance,<br />
<br />
With her wings of majestic beauty,<br />
With feathers of red, green and blue,<br />
She made the calm sky brightly sunny,<br />
And none on this world didnâ€™t have a clue,<br />
<br />
Who is she? The lovely little damsel?<br />
Whose mere existence is refining my conscience?<br />
She makes all the worldly knots unravel,<br />
Breaking the boundaries put by science,<br />
<br />
With her majestic wings and peculiar smile,<br />
She basked in the sunshine hovering for a while,<br />
As she hovered she dived into a cloud,<br />
And out came a thunderous storm,<br />
<br />
The storm rained black and blue,<br />
Its rain cleansed my sins and woe,<br />
It restored my world to the way it was,<br />
Free from all forms of worry and foe,<br />
<br />
Unaware to all the Phoenix had fears,<br />
That nobody shall see her tears,<br />
Tears that flow on seeing people hurt,<br />
She wanted to cleanse the people of dirt,<br />
<br />
The storm that brewed was not of the clouds,<br />
But the rage and pain that brewed in her soul,<br />
With her charm, she fooled us with the clouds,<br />
And her tears were the rain that fell to heal,<br />
<br />
The sun rises and sets every day,<br />
But it was dark even today,<br />
The dance she offered today,<br />
Was something to be hailed every day!<br />
<br />
Out came a gust that swept the world,<br />
That filled our hearts with bliss,<br />
It was the songs of the lovely damsel,<br />
That echoed all around the world,<br />
<br />
Her voice echoed into everyone's heart,<br />
Reaching the unreached and heard by all,<br />
It travelled even the deepest of voids,<br />
The cruellest of hearts and through strongest of barriers,<br />
<br />
We all have rules and principles,<br />
Even a religion to show our face,<br />
Simple or profound all have one,<br />
All designed to keep us safe,<br />
<br />
But when she danced, there was a tremor,<br />
An unnatural sense that words failed to name,<br />
It was the waves of shock and surprise,<br />
That my whole life longed to see,<br />
<br />
I felt the rules get broken,<br />
I sensed my freedom multiply,<br />
It gave me the courage to dare,<br />
The power to question my faith,<br />
<br />
My inhibition tend to fade,<br />
My heart filled with hope,<br />
I dared to leap,<br />
That I feared all my life,<br />
<br />
I broke the false shackles of society,<br />
Realised the bounds that surround me,<br />
From a frog confined to a well,<br />
I became a phoenix, wild and unbounded,<br />
<br />
That dance struck my heart with a cure,<br />
And guided me to greater heights and more,<br />
That dance was not a dance, but a fight,<br />
A fight for the meaning of existence,<br />
<br />
Nor was I the only mortal to feel,<br />
But there were many who went with the wind,<br />
All felt similar remorse at heart,<br />
And did the impossible defined by immortals,<br />
<br />
But that was not the end to the dance,<br />
The dance was rather a choice and chance,<br />
All of a sudden, when all were there to stare,<br />
The damsel stopped and vanished in thin air,<br />
<br />
The lovely Phoenix that filled the sky with delight,<br />
Blew into flames and went out of sight,<br />
Filled the sky with a spectacular light and flare,<br />
Sweeping darkness like a second sun in the sky,<br />
<br />
Out came the feathers all lit with flames,<br />
Turned into ashes as they touched the grounds,<br />
Ashes untouched filled the lands with meadows,<br />
And among the blades of grass stood a baby bird,<br />
<br />
Among the fortunate who took the ashes,<br />
Their hearts were filled with fire,<br />
A fire that taught passion and compassion,<br />
A fire for meaning, a fire for existence,<br />
<br />
For the sceptical mortals who chose to avoid,<br />
Life was still colourless and void,<br />
For the strugglers and believers who chose to see,<br />
Life always went flamboyant and sane,<br />
<br />
The strugglers and believers who realised the dance,<br />
Who knew it was a choice and chance,<br />
Stood like a lighthouse strong against the waves,<br />
And guided many ships amidst turbulent oceans,<br />
<br />
When coerced, forced, humiliated or betrayed,<br />
Even when the entire world stood against my will,<br />
I stood strong like a king and fought, when,<br />
The damsel appeared and saved my skull,<br />
<br />
Whenever in solitude, alone or in grief,<br />
I remember the dance that lovely damsel gave,<br />
It filled my heart with ecstasy and belief,<br />
That happily haunted me till my grave,<br />
<br />
The dance of the damsel was a message to all,<br />
What everyone can do! In the form of a phoenix!<br />
Those who seek true glory do in front of all,<br />
The Flamboyant Dance of the Phoenix!</div>
