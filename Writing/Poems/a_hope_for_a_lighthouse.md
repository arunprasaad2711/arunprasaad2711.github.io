# A Hope for a Lighthouse

| It's been years since I started this voyage,
| Sailing among the currents, I've reached this far.
| From where I am, I see no trace of land,
| I am all alone, in a meadow of blue waves.
| 
| I started this voyage, with so much optimism,
| With a naivety so vast, the oceans were tiny.
| Battered by waves, and many stormy nights,
| I am now scarred, with skin burnt by the winds.
| 
| Sailing all alone, I liked the comfort of the dark,
| For it was gentle, and it hugged me like my mother.
| And it showed me the stars, and their many tales,
| A welcome escape, from the salted reality.
| 
| Should I call myself weak? For accepting the hug,
| I got quite attached, to the escape so much,
| That I stand helpless when my nights ruined,
| By the storms and waves, and the night's cold fury.
| 
| In the calm that follows, I remain in tatters,
| Barely surviving the storm, grappling to any support.
| I felt thirsty and searched for some water to drink,
| That's when the ocean, taught me what irony means.
| 
| Was it my fault? For my sail to be odd?
| With so much conflict, yet it moves on!
| I often feel envious, for the fare journey others have,
| They do have hardships, yet they reach the shore.
| 
| How many times, can I search within me?
| To scrap the remains of some hope that is there?
| It's hard to sustain, a burning fire against the wind,
| Let alone the embers that are lingering for long.
| 
| Every night when I sleep, in the cold dark emptiness,
| I hope for a miracle, and I hope for the winds,
| I hope for strength, and I hope for wisdom,
| I hope for the shore, and I hope for a lighthouse.
