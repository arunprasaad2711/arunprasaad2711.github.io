A place far away
================

| There is a place, far away,
| I want to be there someday!
| As I sail, on this wavy bay,
| I can only hope and pray!
| 
| I float now, on these blue waters,
| With stories from many trotters,
| With no place to call my quarters,
| Moving with gems that matters.
| 
| Travelling far and wide,
| An emptiness lurks inside,
| Casting all the happiness aside,
| And giving me an emotional ride!
| 
| There is this place, quite far away,
| My heart yearns to be there every day,
| The darkness in me, tells every day,
| My trials don't matter in any way.
| 
| I started this voyage, full of hope,
| And tied the masts with a strong rope,
| Now I fear, if my voyage is a trope,
| And I hope, that there is still hope!
| 
| I sailed over regions left and right!
| Yet the dream place was not in sight!
| Will I get there before my eternal night?
| This is a test: a test of my might!
