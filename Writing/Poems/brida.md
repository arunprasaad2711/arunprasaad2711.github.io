# Brida

| With a backpack in hand,
| She travels the vast land,
| Lover of mother nature,
| Whose bond you\'ll nurture.
| 
| A free and untied spirit,
| With unquestionable merit.
| When happy she is chatty,
| When tempted, she is flirty.
| 
| In magic, she believes,
| Admiration, she receives.
| Quite broken by the past,
| Yet she is not lost.
| 
| A teller of great stories,
| Visiting many territories.
| Her journey is very long,
| To make her happy tag along.
| 
| A seeker of connection,
| Pondering on life\'s reflections.
| Bold and beautiful soul,
| She strives to reach her goal.
| 
| An unrelenting integrity,
| Ruthless to the nitty-gritty.
| Yet she has a kind face,
| Walking with stylish grace.
