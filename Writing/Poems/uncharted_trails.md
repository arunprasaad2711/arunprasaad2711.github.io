Uncharted Trails
================

| With every step, I move forward,
| Into the wilderness, into the unknown.
| For there is no time for glances backwards,
| For the past is history and it is known.
| 
| The roads I travel go up and down,
| Past rivers and mountains, and valleys and hills.
| In my heart, I am a king without a crown,
| Still, I walk with humility and pick many skills.
| 
| I was once stubborn, rigid as a mountain,
| The river of life flowed and eroded my pride.
| Now I am humble, with springs and fountains,
| With a valley and a trail, to walk side-by-side.
| 
| The more I travel, the more I got lost,
| The more I find my way out, the more real I feel.
| Trekking a mountain or a valley is the cost,
| The price I pay for my broken heart to heal.
| 
| The more I wander in the wilderness outside,
| The more I ponder in the chaos inside.
| The more I learn about nature on the outside,
| The more I learn about my nature on the inside.
| 
| I am not a tree, with roots fixed to a spot,
| And when I stopped walking, I felt lost.
| Amidst troubles, I learnt to walk at all cost,
| For not all who wander are truly lost.
