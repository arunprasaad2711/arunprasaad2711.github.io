For a Friend
============

| Some friends are like stars in the sky,
| They maybe near or may be far.
| When the sun is bright, they might not be seen.
| Yet they never leave your side.
| 
| Even on a cold, moonless night,
| They are there, watching over you.
| Holding your hand, and spreading warmth,
| Lighting your sky, keeping your hopes up.
| 
| All I ask you, my dear friend,
| Is not to lose hope, for I am there for you,
| Like the stars, that watch over you,
| I maybe far, but my thoughts are with you.
| 
| Like the polestar that guides,
| A lost sailor on turbulent waves,
| I'll hold your hand and walk with you,
| Can I have that honour, my dear friend?
