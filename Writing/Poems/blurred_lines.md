# Blurred Line

| The mind wandered, between memories and dreams,
| It's quite scattered, jumping between extremes.
| Feeling quite shattered, when the door shut again,
| Pained and battered, and injured once again.
| 
| A spiralling madness, took over the thoughts,
| A silent sadness, made many emotional knots,
| A seeping darkess, masked all the plots,
| A creeping loneliness, took all the slots.
| 
| Trying to see, the errors of the past,
| Trying to free, the shackles of the past,
| What's the fee, this pain shall cost?
| To set free, a heart truly lost?
| 
| In the darkness, as the tears roll down,
| In the sadness, the heart does frown,
| In the madness, it searches the town,
| In the loneliness, for an answer on its own.
| 
| The heart craves, for an affectionate word,
| Tired fighting knaves, it seeks for a sword.
| Beaten by waves, while sailing on a board,
| It still craves, to be truly adored.
| 
| The lines blurred, between truth and lies,
| The words slurred, as the time truly flies.
| The memories stirred, and in pain the heart cries,
| It rests deterred, to heal it silently lies.
