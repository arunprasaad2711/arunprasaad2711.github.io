# A Dreamer's Nightmare

Is this the real life?
You wonder all the time.
Is this a fantasy?
You want to see reality.

In dreams, you saw,
All the endless possibilities.
Yet when you wake up,
You see the ending realities.

Floating over clouds,
All seems perfect,
Waking up to reality,
The dreams dissolve.

Amidst all the distractions,
Striving to find hope,
Keeping the fantasies alive,
Against time and space.

What if that idea,
You chased all your life,
You hope to make it real,
Is a mere fantasy?

A lie you tell to yourself,
All the time to keep you safe,
When that is take away,
What are you, my dreamer?
