Behind the Door
===============

| Behind the smile, lurked a melancholy,
| The face with a smile can hide the pain away,
| But the heart wept, over the folly,
| The eyes don't lie, and they give it away.
| 
| Behind the door, we choose to hide,
| A tide of emotions, and a thunderstorm,
| For the places present, for one to confide,
| Are hard to find, amidst the winter storms.
| 
| In the pool of tears, while the silence screams,
| The heart in discord vents its bare soul.
| Trying to pick up the broken pieces and dreams,
| It tries to mend them, despite the heavy toll.
| 
| What truly lies, inside the wounded heart?
| No one knows, except the walls and the door.
| Will the pain shall pass, and get a new start?
| No one knows, not even the walls and door!
