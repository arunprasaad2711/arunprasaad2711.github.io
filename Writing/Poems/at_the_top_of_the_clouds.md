# At the top of the clouds

| In a world, that never ceases to spin,
| In a time, that forces you to always win,
| You being content with where you are now,
| Will earn you the name, as flaky as snow.
| 
| It is always hard, to follow your dreams,
| To make a living on your hopes and dreams.
| It might mean, to have a simple living,
| Away from the race, of abundant craving.
| 
| It is always hard, to follow your dreams,
| There are many voices, to silence your dreams,
| A life that reflects, your values and principles,
| It is in itself, a massive and noble feat.
| 
| To move slowly with peace, and with grace,
| In a world that demands you to run seems disgrace.
| Let me remind you: that you are quite brave,
| To avoid the temptations, and to follow your heart.
| 
| When ambition is seen, only as an ascend on a ladder,
| The eyes that see so, might see your work as fodder.
| It takes guts to take an undemanding job,
| To fully invest your soul in your true dream job.
| 
| Ignore the nay sayers, for they are abundant in number,
| They will come everyday, after you break every slumber.
| If you don't pursue hard, for what is your heart's desire,
| Can you expect anyone else, to do it for you my friend?
| 
| There might be suffering, in pursuing what is right,
| And there is a lot of pain, to swim against the stream.
| A job and salary are mere means to end,
| They do help your life, but they don't define you my friend.
| 
| You'll be told in million ways, that you are wrong,
| Be strong and bold, to not sell yourself out.
| Get help when needed, and move onward and upward,
| At the top of the clouds, lies the eternal sunshine!
