Here's to an Eternal Happiness
==============================

| When two such hearts filled with dreams,
| Meet by chance, set-up by destiny,
| It's just time, a matter of time,
| For the fire to kindle, and love to blossom.
| 
| While it is true, that this is another story,
| Of love and tussle and likes and pet peeves,
| Yet this story is special, potent, and strong,
| Caring and nurturing, patient and kind.
| 
| It all started, with the ambi going blind,
| Blind in love after talking to the ladki.
| Yet he didn't lose the light in his heart,
| Nor his sight to do what is quite right.
| 
| He gathered with might, all the good words,
| And opened up his heart, and told his love.
| Sadly the time was unkind, and even decieving,
| For the ladki did not, reciprocate his love.
| 
| For months there was, a lot of tussle,
| There was friendship, and there was more,
| To be or not to be, wondered the ladki,
| To be and indefinitely said ambi hopefully!
| 
| With time and with space, the ladki did see,
| The kind and good heart, of this sweet ambi.
| She who thought that this won't be possible,
| Got the courage to see, a union of two states.
| 
| It was time for love, and love was in the air,
| The air still does smell, with love to share.
| A love that grew, patiently with time,
| And planned it's way for a better future.
| 
| A love that took years, six years to build,
| From friends to lovers to betrotheds to spouses.
| Amidst all the distance, and oceans and timezones,
| The hearts built together, a hopeful future.
| 
| There was drama, there were fights,
| These two although married, might still fight,
| Yet amidst the fights, the love shall prevail,
| And it will grow stronger and bind their hearts tighter.
| 
| What can I give, this lovely little couple?
| I only wish them, my thoughts and wishes!
| Thoughts and wishes for a great grand life!
| Filled with hope and joy and wonder!
| 
| I am grateful for this lovely couple!
| For they remind me, of what love can be!
| For Ganesh and Sonal, I rise for a toast!
| Here's to the couple for an eternal happiness!
